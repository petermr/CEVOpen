<p class="p">Samples were analyzed by GC-MS and the data were analyzed using the MetAlign
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup>. Software (version 3.0, Wageningen University, 2011, 
 <uri xlink:href="http://www.MetAlign.nl" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.MetAlign.nl</uri>). In this untargeted approach, the software was used to align and compare full scan GC-MS chromatograms and assess possible difference between samples. Raw data from GC-MS chromatograms were imported into MetAlign
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup>, and baseline correction, denoising and smoothing of the data were carried out. This was achieved by setting parameters in the MetAlign
 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> interface, where the minimum peak threshold to eliminate noise that would interfere with peak alignment, was determined. Spectral alignment was performed using the rough mode, where ion fragments originating from chromatographic peaks with corresponding retention times were aligned across all samples.
