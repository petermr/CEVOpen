 <italic>In vitro</italic>, 
 <italic>O. sanctum</italic> leaf extracts exhibited significant anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-stimulated monocytic cells, reducing cytokine production and decreasing TNF-

 <xref rid="B194" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>]. More recently, a triple-blind randomized clinical study compared an ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>O. sanctum</italic> with chlorhexidine mouthwash in regards to their effect on dental plaque and gingival inflammation and found that the two are equivalent. Additionally, the 
 <italic>O. sanctum</italic> extract was better tolerated and had no side effects [
