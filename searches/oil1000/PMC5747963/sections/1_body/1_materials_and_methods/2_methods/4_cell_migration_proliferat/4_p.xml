<p class="p">In particular, this test enabled identification of cell proliferation properties by assessing 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in DNA synthesis. To this aim, in the last hour of culture, cells were labeled by adding 30 mM BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich) to the medium; then cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 70% ethanol. The incorporation of BrdU was detected by an immunostaining reaction with anti-BrdU antibody (Amersham Bioscience, VWR) as follows: the substrates were washed with PBS and incubated with HCl 2N for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were neutralized in 0.1 M sodium tetraborate (pH 8.5) for 15 min, washed twice for 5 min in PBS, and incubated for 20 min in a blocking solution, consisting of 1% w/v bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.02% w/v Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS. Cells were then incubated for 1 h with mouse anti-BrdU antibody, diluted 1:100 w/v in blocking solution, washed 3 times (10 min each) with the same solution and then incubated for 30 min in blocking solution containing anti-mouse immunoglobulin G fluorescein isothiocyanate-antibody (1:100 w/v dilution, Sigma-Aldrich). Finally, cell substrates were again extensively washed with PBS, counterstained for DNA with 0.5 mg/mL Hoechst 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich), and mounted in Mowiol (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells characterized by positive BrdU immunofluorescence were counted by using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiophot, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).</p>
