<p class="p">Stock solutions at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in methanol and Trolox were prepared from
 <italic class="italic"> R. chalepensis</italic> essential oils that were collected from three Palestinian regions. Each one of these stock solutions was diluted in methanol to prepare 12 of the working solutions with the following concentrations: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 80, and 100 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/ml. A freshly prepared DPPH solution (0.002% w/v) was mixed with both methanol and with each of the above-mentioned working solutions at 1 : 1 : 1 ratio. In addition, a negative control solution was prepared by mixing the mentioned DPPH solution with methanol in 1 : 1 ratio. All of these solutions were incubated at room temperature in a dark cabinet for 30 min. By the end of the incubation period, the optical density of these solutions was determined spectrophotometrically at a wave length of 517 nm using methanol as the blank solution.
