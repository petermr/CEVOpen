<p>In this study, the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC), and the Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) of HR and SGR essential oils were investigated against the Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and yeasts. It was found that both essential oils showed similar properties. The essential oils showed stronger antibacterial (MIC = 125–250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) than antifungal activity (MIC = 625–1250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>). The highest antibacterial activity with a MIC value of 125 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL was observed against
 <italic> Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and
 <italic> Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. No significant difference in susceptibility was found between Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>). In order to address the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of the samples, the MBC values were also evaluated. The MBC values are no more than four times the MIC values observed (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>).
