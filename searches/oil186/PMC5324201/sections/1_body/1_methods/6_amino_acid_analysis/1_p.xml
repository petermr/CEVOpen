<p>The root powder sample (5.0 g) was refluxed with 6 M HCl (50 mL) at 110 °C for 24 h for protein hydrolysis. Then the solution was kept in an evaporating dish to evaporate HCl on a water bath. The residue was again dissolved in 20 mL 0.1 M HCl and evaporation was repeated twice to remove excess of the acid. It was then filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper with 0.1 M HCl in a volumetric flask which was known as a stock solution. Again, the stock solution was filtered through 0.45 μm syringe filter with pressure for amino acid analysis [

The sample amino acids were identified by comparing with standard amino acids retention times and calculated the percentage of their individual areas.
