 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> showed that the reducing power of essential oil from 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> rhizomes was in a concentration-dependent manner and increased with the concentration, and the absorbance value significantly increased from 0.15 at 200 μg/mL to 0.74 at 1000 μg/mL. These results suggested that the essential oil from 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> rhizomes could result in reducing Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>/ferricyanide complex to the ferrous form (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>), and had a remarkable potency to donate electron to reactive free radicals, transforming them into more stable non-reactive species and terminating the free radical chain reaction.
