<p>The antimicrobial activities are responsible for oxygenated monoterpenes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The appreciable antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Anethum sowa</italic> L. may be attributed to the presence of monoterpenes compounds in the oil. On the other hand, the activity of the essential oil can be explained by the chemical structure of the major constituents of the oil. Apiol has a nucleus containing a polar functional group that is known to form hydrogen bonds with the active sites of the target enzyme [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. It is assumed that the antimicrobial activity may be responsible for its apiol constituents, on the basis of that mechanism. The Gram-positive bacteria are generally more sensitive to the spice and herb essential oil than Gram-negative bacteria due to an outer membrane and a unique periplasmic space in the Gram-positive bacteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The essential oil degrades the cell wall of the organism by interacting with the essential oil component which causes disrupt cytoplasmic membrane and damage membrane protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. However, it did not completely follow the trend described above and showed the potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Nonetheless, the antimicrobial activity of essential oils may be due to the synergistic effect of the major compounds of the oil and also combined with another minor constituent. The results of the standard antibiotic showed the stronger activity against most of the bacterial species than the essential oil.
