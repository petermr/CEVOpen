<p>In endothelium-intact aorta (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6), steady tension was evoked by Phen (1 μM), then, AcEO (10
 <sup>−4</sup>–10
 <sup>−1</sup> mg/ml) was cumulatively added to the Krebs solution. The contribution of endothelium, muscarinic receptor and subsequent Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-CaM complex formation in the vasorelaxation-induced effect was checked out by the application of experiments described by Monteiro et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Denuded rings (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) were obtained by gentile rubbing of the lumen of aorta with a plier curved end, and the denudation was verified by the absence of any degree of relaxation caused by carbachol (10
 <sup>−4</sup> M), then, AcEO (10-4–10-1 mg/ml) was cumulatively added. In another set of experiments, endothelium-intact rings were pre-incubated with the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (1 μM; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-Calmodulin binding to NOS blocker calmidazolium chloride (10
 <sup>−3</sup>μM; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) for 20 min prior the contraction with Phen (1 μM), then, the cumulative concentration–response curves of AcEO were constructed and compared with those obtained with untreated rings.
