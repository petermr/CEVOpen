<p id="Par26" class="p">GC-MS analyses were performed using a capillary HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm I.D., 0.25 μm film thickness; Agilent Technologies) with gas chromatography (Agilent Technologies 7820A) coupled directly to the mass detector (Agilent Technologies 5975 series MSD). Helium was used as carrier gas, with a constant flow rate of 1 ml/ min. The injector and detector temperatures were 230 °C. The oven temperature was programmed from 150 to 320 °C at 10 °C·min − 1 from 150 to 250 °C and at 5 °C·min − 1 from 250 to 320 °C. Manual injection of 1 μL of the aliphatic alcohol solution was performed in the split mode at a 10:1 split ratio. The policosanol compounds were identified by comparing their mass spectra with the Wiley 275.L Mass Spectral Library.</p>
