<p>The antibacterial activities of 
 <italic>C. decurren</italic>s, 
 <italic>C. sempervirens</italic> and 
 <italic>T. articulata </italic>essential oils against the tested Gram-positive and Gram- negative baeteria are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>. The essential oils under investigation inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> at concentrations 0.023- 0.442 µL/mL. Essential oil of 
 <italic>C. sempervirens</italic> showed inhibition of the growth of 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> at concentration 0.84 µL/mL, while essential oils of 
 <italic>C. decurren</italic>s and 
 <italic>T. articulata </italic>at concentrations up to 64 µL/mL showed no inhibition of the growth of 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>. 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> showed no susceptibility to essential oil of 
 <italic>C. decurren</italic>s, while all the tested Gram-negative microorganisms showed growth inhibition by the effect of essential oils of 
 <italic>C. sempervirens</italic> and 
 <italic>T. articulata </italic>at concentrations range 0.037- 3.031 µL/mL. In addition, all the tested essential oils excreted bactericidal activities against all the susceptible Gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms at concentration range 0.155- 6.72 µL/mL. 
 <italic>C. sempervirens</italic> showed the highest antibacterial activities against most of the tested bacterial strains.
