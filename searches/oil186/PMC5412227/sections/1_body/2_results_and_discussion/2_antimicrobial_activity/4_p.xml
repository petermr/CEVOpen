 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> shows that the oils in this study act as potential antimicrobial agents since the required Gram-positive organisms corresponding to each MIC were low (from 80 to 160 μg/m1, except for the standard strain E. 
 <italic>faecalis</italic> which needs 640 μg/m1 to become sensitive to the oils). Although the essential oils presented a higher MIC for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> at 640 μg/m1, the analyzed Gram-negative bacteria exhibit strong activity for the essential oils.
