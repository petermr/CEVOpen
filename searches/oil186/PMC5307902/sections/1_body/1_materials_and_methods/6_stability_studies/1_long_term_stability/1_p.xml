<p>The macroscopic aspect, CI, pH, and conductivity were evaluated on storage days 1, 3, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180. The samples were stored at room temperature (25 ± 2°C) and at a low temperature (5 ± 1°C). These parameters enabled the evaluation of the emulsion system stability and therefore the prediction of the chemical stability of the components of the emulsion.</p>
