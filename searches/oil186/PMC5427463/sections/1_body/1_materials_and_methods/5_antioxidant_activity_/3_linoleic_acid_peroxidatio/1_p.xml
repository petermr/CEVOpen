<p>In this assay, the antioxidant capacity of SoEO on inhibition of lipid peroxidation was assessed (Hui et al., 2010[
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). 0.2804 g of Tween 20 and 0.2804 g of linoleic acid were mixed in 50 mL of PBS (200 mM, pH 7.0) to prepare the linoleic acid emulsion. 2.5 mL of linoleic acid emulsion and 2 mL of PBS (200 mM, pH 7.0) were added to 0.5 mL of different concentrations of SoEO (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1 mg/mL) and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. Then, 100 µL of the reaction mixture, 100 µL of ammonium thiocyanate solution (30 %) and 100 µL of ferrous chloride solution (20 mM/ in HCl) were added to 9.7 mL of ethanol (75 %). After stirring for 3 min the absorbance was measured at 500 nm. α-Tocopherol was used as a positive control solution without adding SoEO or α-tocopherol was used as blank. The percentage of antioxidant activity was determined using the following Eq. (2):
