<p class="p">The
 <italic class="italic"> p</italic>-anisidine value of the oil was 0.08 and lower than that of 0.30 reported for
 <italic class="italic"> Salvia hispanica</italic> L. seed oil [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The total oxidation (TOTOX) value of 2.06 was lower than those of vegetable oils reported in the literature and indicates high primary and secondary oxidative stability [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The oxidative stability of
 <italic class="italic"> L. kerstingii</italic> seed oil was 52.53 h at 120°C. This value was higher than those of palm kernel oil (26.80 h) and refined-bleached-deodorized palm olein (25.50 h) measured at 110°C [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The low level of polyunsaturated fatty acids provides the oil with high oxidative stability [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The double bounds in polyunsaturated are more reactive than a double bound in a monounsaturated chain [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Consequently, the high level of monounsaturated fatty acids and the high proportion of saturated fatty acids in
 <italic class="italic"> L. kerstingii</italic> seed oil are factors that positively contribute to the oil oxidative stability.
