<p class="p">The quantification of biofilm production was based on microtiter plate biofilm assay (MTP): an opportune dilution of bacterial culture in exponential growth phase was added into wells of a sterile 96-well flat-bottomed polystyrene plate in absence and in presence of each EO. Quantification of in vitro biofilm production was based on previously reported methodology [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Briefly, the wells of a sterile 96-well flat-bottomed polystyrene plate were filled with 100 µL of the appropriate medium. 1/100 dilution of overnight bacterial cultures was added into each well (about 0.5 OD 600nm). As control, the first row contained bacteria grown in 100 μL of BHI (untreated bacteria). In the second row was added BHI supplemented with each EO at concentrations of 3.125 mg/mL and 0.0488 mg/mL, respectively. The plates were incubated aerobically for 18 h at 37 °C. Biofilm formation was measured using crystal violet staining. After treatment, planktonic cells were gently removed; each well was washed three times with double-distilled water and patted dry with a piece of paper towel in an inverted position. To quantify biofilm formation, each well was stained with 0.1% crystal violet and incubated for 15 min at room temperature, rinsed twice with double-distilled water, and thoroughly dried. The dye bound to adherent cells was solubilized with 20% (

Each data point is composed of 4 independent experiments, each performed at least in 3-replicates. EOs altering biofilm formation of selected strains were then tested as reported below. Briefly, the wells of a sterile 96-well flat-bottomed polystyrene plate were filled with 100 µL of the appropriate medium. 1/100 dilution of overnight bacterial cultures was added into each well (about 0.5 OD 600nm). As control, the first row contained bacteria grown in 100 μL of BHI (untreated bacteria). Furthermore, BHI broth was added to remaining wells starting from the third row. In the second row was added BHI supplemented with each EO at a concentration of 0.0488 mg/mL. Starting from this lane, samples were serially diluted (1:2 dilutions). The plates were incubated aerobically for 18 h at 37 °C. Biofilm formation was measured using crystal violet staining, as previously reported.
