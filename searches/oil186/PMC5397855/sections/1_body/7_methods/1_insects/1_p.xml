<p>Individuals of 
 <italic>T. molitor</italic> were obtained from the Laboratory of Biological Control of the Institute of Applied Biotechnology to Agriculture (BIOAGRO, Universidade Federal de Viçosa) in Viçosa, Minas Gerais State, Brasil. Adults of 
 <italic>T. molitor</italic> were kept in plastic trays (60 cm long × 40 cm wide × 12 cm) and maintained at 25 ± 1 °C, 70 ± 10% RH and 12:12 h L:D photoperiod. These adults were fed 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic> with wheat bran (12% protein, 2% lipids, 75% carbohydrates and 11% mineral/sugar), pieces of sugarcane, 
 <italic>Saccharum officinarum</italic> (L.) (Poaceae) and chayote 
 <italic>Sechium edule</italic> (Jacq.) Swartz (Cucurbitaceae). Sheets of paper were placed on the substrate to prevent the stress from insects and facilitate oviposition. Healthy larvae, pupae and adults of 
 <italic>T. molitor</italic> without amputations, apparent malformations or nutritional deficiencies were used in the bioassays.
