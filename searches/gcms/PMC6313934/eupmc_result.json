    "Two modern rose varieties, Floribunda and Hybrid Tea, were used to analyze and identify metabolic changes after foliar application with benzyladenine (BA). Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as metabolites were detected. Two pairs of doses of BA, at 11.16 and 17.87 mg/cm², and 7.17 and 12.26 mg/cm² were applied to the foliage of Hybrid Tea and Floribunda, respectively. Sampling time was optimized and treatment duration was 4 weeks. After treatment, the volatiles from the treated and untreated control roses were extracted using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) technology by three-phase fiber 50/30 µm divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) coupled with a flame ionization detector (FID), and with mass spectrometry (GC-MS).The results showed that BA and its dose rate led to metabolic changes of treated roses in comparison with untreated controls. The number of VOCs extracted and detected from leaves, stem, rhizosphere and whole plants from the two rose varieties at doses rate of 17.87 and 12.26 mg/cm² were 43, 65, 40 and 68 compounds for each plant material, respectively, for both rose varieties. Whilst the VOCs extracted and detected from both rose varieties for leaves, stem, rhizosphere and whole plants were 38, 61, 34 and 66 compounds for each plant material, respectively. The results demonstrate that some volatiles, such as 4-Heptyn-2-ol, Phenyl methyl ether and 3-Methyl-apopinene, increased with increasing doses of BA; these compounds are aroma chemicals with a very powerful smell. This study shows that BA treatments can have a significant effect on metabolite changes in different rose tissues. This method could be applied to other floriculture plants."
