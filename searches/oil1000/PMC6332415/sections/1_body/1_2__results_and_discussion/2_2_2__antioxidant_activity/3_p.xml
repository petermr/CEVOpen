 <xref rid="B42-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] indicates that the ethyl acetate fraction of an ethanolic extract of 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> showed higher antioxidant activity against ABTS•+ than the hexane and chloroform fractions. This activity is due to the high content of phenolic compounds, which could be most effective in protecting the body against various oxidative stressors.
