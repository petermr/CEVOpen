<p id="Par30" class="p">The antioxidant activity was determined according to the β-carotene bleaching method described by Pratt [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. A stock solution of β-carotene/linoleic acid mixture was prepared as follows: 0.5 mg of β-carotene (PubChem CID: 5,280,489) was dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform (PubChem CID: 6212) with 25 μl of linoleic acid (PubChem CID: 5,280,450) and 200 mg of Tween-20 (PubChem CID: 443,314). Chloroform was completely evaporated, using a vacuum evaporator. Then, 100 ml of distilled water, saturated with oxygen (30 min), were added and the obtained solution was vigorously shaken. Four ml of this reaction mixture were dispensed into test tubes and 200 μl of each sample, prepared at different concentrations, were added. The emulsion system was incubated for 2 h at 50 °C. The same procedure was repeated with Butylated hydoxytoluene (BHT) as positive control and a blank as a negative control. After this incubation period, the absorbance of each mixture was measured at 490 nm. Antioxidant activity in β-carotene bleaching model in percentage (A %) was calculated with the following equation: A %  = 1 − (A
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> – A
 <sub class="sub">t</sub>/A
 <sup class="sup">’</sup>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>−A
 <sup class="sup">’</sup>
 <sub class="sub">t</sub>) × 100, where A
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> and A’
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> are absorbances of the sample and the blank, respectively, measured at zero time, and A 
 <sub class="sub">t</sub> and A’
 <sub class="sub">t</sub> are absorbances of the sample and the blank, respectively, measured after 2 h. All tests were carried out in triplicate.
