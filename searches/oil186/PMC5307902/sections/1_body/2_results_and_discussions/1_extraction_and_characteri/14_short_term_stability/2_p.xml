<p>The micro-emultocrit technique (MET) was first described by Macedo, Fernandes,[
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] as an appropriate tool to evaluate and predict influences provided by small variations in the HLB values on emulsions. Thus, besides the simplicity, the ability to use a low amount of sample and with a short time of execution made this method an excellent tool to evaluate and/or optimize formulation parameters and their respective HLB values. The results of the short term stability study are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 4</xref>. Regarding the creaming index data, the lowest CI rates were observed at time D1 for the formulations F3, F4, F5 and F6, where CI were 3.62%, 3.43%, 3.47%, and 3.51%, respectively. After 30 days (D30), lower CI were observed for F1, F2, F3, F4, and F5 (2.42%, 1.88%; 1.81%; 1.83% and 1.78%, respectively). And, on the last day of analysis (D90), the CI for F1, F2, F3 and F4 were 2.43%, 1.75%; 2.9%, and 1.73% respectively.
