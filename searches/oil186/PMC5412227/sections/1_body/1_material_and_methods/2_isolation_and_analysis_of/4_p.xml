<p>GC-MS analysis was carried out in an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph interfaced with an Agilent 5973 MSD applying helium as the carrier gas (0.9 ml/min, and the same capillary column previously mentioned). The column temperature was raised from 50 (hold 3 min) to 180 “C at the rate of 5 “C/min and to 240 “C at 10 “C/min rate; and then was kept stable for an additional 20 min at 280 °C. The injector and detector temperatures were 200 and 280 °C, respectively. A 0.3-μl sample was injected using the split mode (split ratio 50:1). Oil components were analyzed and identified by comparison of MS fragmentation pattern with that of pure compounds, corresponding data in the literature (Adams 2007) and/or computer mass spectra libraries (Wiley 138K and NIST 98). For gaining the retention indices, a standard solution of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C6-C26) was used (Jennings and Shibamoto 1980). Also, the electronic integration of the FID peak areas without using any correction factors was employed for obtaining quantitative data.
