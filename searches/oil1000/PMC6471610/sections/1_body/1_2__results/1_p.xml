<p class="p">Using the traditional maceration method (conditions are mentioned in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01062-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, see Materials and Methods) myrislignan and elemicin were established at 22.59% and 13.99%, respectively, (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01062-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Maceration as a method was modified with magnesium aluminometasilicate (0.5%, 1%, and 2% excipient), but the results were not significant. The magnesium aluminometasilicate did not increase the quantity of chemical compounds, so these conditions and results were not mentioned in the research.
