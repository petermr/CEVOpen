<p class="p">The effectiveness of thyme oil as an antifungal agent can be noticed from the data presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-00045-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>. As can be seen, thyme essential oil is more active than clove essential oil, showing an inhibition rate of 100% at 10 µL, while clove oil was less effective (
 <italic class="italic">IR</italic> = 47.6%) at a volume of 10 µL. As well, tea tree essential oil has antifungal properties, but when a higher oil volume is used. It produced an inhibition of 89.04% for a quantity of 40 µL. It is considered that the antifungal activity of tea tree oil was significantly affected by the presence of high content of γ-terpinene (16.3%), 4-terpineol (38.7%), and α-terpineol (4.6%). Previous studies showed that tea tree oil has antifungal activity against
