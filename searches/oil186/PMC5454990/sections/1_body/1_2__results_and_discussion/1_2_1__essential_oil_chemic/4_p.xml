<p>In addition, these chemical compounds were identified in the leaves in other Lauraceae species. The EO of leaves of 
 <italic>Endlicheria arenosa</italic> was dominated by bicyclogermacrene (42.2%), germacrene D (12.5%), and β-caryophyllene (10.1%) [
 <xref rid="B23-ijms-18-01081" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Similarly, the EO of 
 <italic>Nectandra leucantha</italic> showed as the main compounds bicyclogermacrene (28.4%), germacrene A (7.3%), α-pinene (6.6%), and β-pinene (4.6%) [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-18-01081" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The sesquiterpene δ-cadinene identified in the EO of branches was detected as the main compound in EOs of leaf and bark of 
 <italic>Beilschmiedia madang</italic> (17.0% and 20.5%, respectively) and was associated with germacrene D in the oil of barks of 
 <italic>Beilschmiedia glabra</italic> [
