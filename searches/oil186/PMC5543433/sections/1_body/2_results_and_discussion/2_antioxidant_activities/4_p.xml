<p id="Par46">Monoterpene hydrocarbons; particularly terpinolene, α- and γ-terpinene, could also be taken into account for the antioxidative activity observed, but obviously, none has stronger than that of oxygenated monoterpenes. The presence of strongly activated methylene groups in these molecules is probably the reason for this behavior. On the other hand, sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons and their oxygenated derivatives have very low antioxidant activity [

 <italic>Cl</italic>EO, which are better than that of BHT, a very efficient synthetic antioxidant agent which is widely used in food technology. Basically, interest has increased noticeably in the research of naturally occurring antioxidants for use in foods or medicinal materials as an alternative to synthetic antioxidants, which are being limited because of their possible toxicity [
