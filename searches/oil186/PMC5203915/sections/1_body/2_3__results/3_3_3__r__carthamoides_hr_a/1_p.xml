<p>The MTT assay was used to determine the cytotoxic effect of
 <italic> R. carthamoides</italic> essential oil from hairy roots and the roots of soil-grown plants (range: 0–3200 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) after 24 h incubation with astrocytes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The viability of cells was decreased below 60% at the higher concentration of essential oils, above 1600
