    "The aim of this research is to evaluate the relationship between genotype, phenotype, and chemical profiles of essential oil obtained from available <i>Zanthoxylum</i> spp. Three specimens of makhwaen (MK) distributed in Northern Thailand were genetically and morphologically compared with other <i>Zanthoxylum</i> spices, known locally as huajiao (HJ) and makwoung (MKO), respectively. HJ was taxonomically confirmed as <i>Z. armatum</i> while MKO and MK were identified as <i>Z. rhetsa</i> and <i>Z. myriacanthum</i>. Genetic sequencing distributed these species into three groups accordingly to their confirmed species. Essential oil of the dried fruits from these samples was extracted and analyzed for their chemical and physical properties. Cluster analysis of their volatile compositions separated MKO and MK apart from HJ with L-limonene, terpinen-4-ol, <i>β</i>-phellandrene, and <i>β</i>-philandrene. By using odor attributes, the essential oil of MKO and MK were closely related possessing fruity, woody, and citrus aromas, while the HJ was distinctive. Overall, the phenotypic characteristic can be used to elucidate the species among makhwaen fruits of different sources. The volatile profiling was nonetheless dependent on the genotypes but makwoung and makhwaen showed similar profiles."
