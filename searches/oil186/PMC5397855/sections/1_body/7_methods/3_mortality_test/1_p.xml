<p>Garlic essential oil efficacy was determined by calculating the lethal concentrations (LC
 <sub>50</sub>, and LC
 <sub>90</sub>) values under laboratory conditions and conducted in triplicate. Six concentrations of garlic essential oil besides the control (acetone) were adjusted in 1 mL of stock solution (essential oil and acetone): 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32% (w/v). Aliquots were taken from the stock solution and mixed with acetone in 5 mL glass vials. Different concentrations of the garlic essential oil were applied in 1 uL solution on the thorax of larva, pupa and adult of 
 <italic>T. molitor</italic>, using a micropipette. For each developmental stage, fifty insects were used per concentration and were placed individually in Petri dishes (Ø 90 mm × 15 mm) with an absorbent paper, fed with chayote and sugarcane 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic> (larvae and adults) and maintained in the dark. The number of dead insects was in each cage was counted after essential oil exposure for 48 h after application. Rates were calculated with a correction for natural mortality
