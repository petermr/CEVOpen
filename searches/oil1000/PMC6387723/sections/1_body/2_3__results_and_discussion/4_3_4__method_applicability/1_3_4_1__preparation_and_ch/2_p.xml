<p class="p">The results of %EL obtained in the present work may be due to the volatile nature of the EO and were in agreement with the findings on the loading of oregano essential oil in chitosan nanoparticles, which have been reported by Hosseini et al. They developed formulations of chitosan nanoparticles with oregano essential oil with a percentage of encapsulation loading in a range of 1.32 to 2.12% [

However, it is important to emphasize that the encapsulation of a complex natural product, such as EO, is a process that represents greater difficulty compared to the encapsulation of a drug, and it requires studies of optimization of EO encapsulation [
