Epidemiological principles governing the design of successful control are not well-understood. We analyse factors underlying the effectiveness of reactive eradication of localised outbreaks of invading plant disease, using citrus canker in Florida as a case study, although our results are largely generic, and apply to other plant pathogens (as we show via our second case study, citrus greening). We demonstrate how to optimise control via removal of hosts surrounding detected infection (i.e. localised culling) using a spatially-explicit, stochastic epidemiological model. We show how to define optimal culling strategies that take account of stochasticity in disease spread, and how the effectiveness of disease control depends on epidemiological parameters determining pathogen infectivity, symptom emergence and spread, the initial level of infection, and the logistics and implementation of detection and control. We also consider how optimal culling strategies are conditioned on the levels of risk acceptance/aversion of decision makers, and show how to extend the analyses to account for potential larger-scale impacts of a small-scale outbreak. Control of local outbreaks by culling can be very effective, particularly when started quickly, but the optimum strategy and its performance are strongly dependent on epidemiological parameters (particularly those controlling dispersal and the extent of any cryptic infection, i.e. infectious hosts prior to symptoms), the logistics of detection and control, and the level of local and global risk that is deemed to be acceptable.

We use mathematical modelling to show how control of such disease outbreaks can be optimised. Although our methods and analyses are generic, we use the attempted eradication of citrus canker from Florida (1996&#x02013;2006) as a case study, and focus upon the performance of reactive culling (i.e. removal of all host plants within a certain distance of detected infection). We show how the cull radius can be optimised, even when there is significant cryptic infection (i.e. infection without visible symptoms). The inherent randomness of disease transmission implies a control strategy can lead to a number of outcomes: the optimal strategy therefore depends on the level of risk that is tolerable. We also consider balancing local vs. global impacts of disease. We show how it can be optimal to control initial outbreaks very extensively, even though this would lead to many local removals, since timely local eradication reduces the risk of a devastating large-scale epidemic.

We focus here on plant disease, motivated by the serious and potentially irreparable ecological damage that can follow introductions of plant pathogens into natural host populations [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and the obvious food security and economic implications of epidemics in crops [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Increased global trade and travel mean the risk of introduction of exotic pathogens can only reasonably be expected to increase [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which in turn indicates control of invasive plant disease is likely to remain important for many years to come.</p><p>We target optimising reactive eradication of small-scale outbreaks of an invading plant pathogen [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] occurring in regions extending from 1-10km. We concentrate on how cryptic infection (i.e. infectivity without symptoms), the inherent stochasticity of epidemics, and uncertainties in the parameters controlling disease spread affect the performance of control via local removal of plant hosts in the vicinity of detected infection. Effectively controlling in this fashion is extremely challenging, requiring an estimate of how far the epidemic has spread ahead of visibly infected regions. Nevertheless, recent modelling studies of a number of plant pathogens have shown how, in principle, control by local removal of susceptible hosts can be effective in managing plant disease [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], even when disease spreads non-locally via complex contact networks [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A consensus has begun to emerge that this type of control can be successful, albeit with the beguilingly simple proviso that there is a need to &#x0201c;match the scale of control with the intrinsic scale of the epidemic&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The obvious problem is that the appropriate scale is very difficult to define, and depends in a complex fashion on the interplay between the epidemiology of the plant-pathogen interaction, the spatial distribution of susceptible hosts, the implementation and logistics of detection and control, and the current state of the epidemic. The quantitative detail of how these factors affect the nature of the optimal control strategy and how effectively it performs is extremely complex, and general principles remain ill-understood. However, identifying such general principles is clearly relevant to the control of all plant diseases.</p><p>Here we use mathematical modelling to investigate epidemiological principles underlying successful control. We consider a range of strategies for management of a newly invading plant pathogen, and identify optimal control scenarios that minimise the &#x0201c;epidemic impact&#x0201d;; we define this to be the total of both the number of hosts lost to disease and healthy hosts removed by control. We show the importance of allowing for the inherent stochasticity of epidemics in comparing control scenarios by analysing the empirical distribution of epidemic impacts for fixed values of epidemiological and control parameters. In particular, we show how the optimal control strategy changes when we take account of different levels of risk aversion [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We further analyse the effects of critical epidemiological and logistic factors on disease control. The following are considered: the rate and spatial scale of disease spread, the initial level of infection, the ability to detect disease, the length of time infection remains cryptic, the frequency of surveying and any notice period or other delay before removal. We also show how accounting for the risk of export of inoculum outside of the region of immediate interest leads to optimum control strategies that differ from those derived by focusing solely on local impacts [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Finally we consider how control is adversely affected if pathogen spread occurs via a thick-tailed dispersal kernel, although we demonstrate that even then an optimal control strategy can still be defined.</p><p>Although the issues we investigate are generic, we illustrate our work in the context of an economically important system for which eradication by reactive culling was attempted: citrus canker (caused by the bacterium <italic>Xanthomonas citri</italic> pv. <italic>citri</italic>) on commercial and residential citrus in Florida. The United States government spent over one billion dollars on survey, control and compensation costs during an eradication campaign that ran from 1996 to 2006 [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] (see <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref> for further details). Aside from the attraction of choosing a prominent and controversial real-world example to frame our analyses, a major motivation for using this system as our case-study is an extremely detailed data set on disease spread in five uncontrolled sites in the Miami region, originally collected by the United States Department of Agriculture [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These data have allowed parsimonious, stochastic, spatially-explicit, epidemiological models to be fitted to the spread of citrus canker that track the disease status of individual host plants [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and here we use a flexible extension of these models to analyse the effectiveness of the control scenarios we consider. We also take advantage of recent work fitting this type of model to huanglongbing disease (also known as HLB or citrus greening) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], a disease of citrus vectored by psyllids and that is caused by <italic>Candidatus</italic> Liberibacter spp. bacteria, in order to demonstrate the flexibility of our methods and the generality of the underlying principles.</p><p>A principal challenge in using epidemiological models to inform policy is rendering the assumptions and outputs of models in forms that can be readily understood and interrogated by policy makers [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. What is needed is a tool to allow epidemiological and disease control scenarios to be explored by regulatory decision makers. This would not only help ensure appropriate action is taken, but would also help ensure factors affecting the success (and the risk of failure) of a preferred control strategy are understood by those who have to make and justify decisions. Epidemiologists have typically adopted a &#x0201c;black-box&#x0201d; approach, in which the analytical process is hidden and where only the resulting control recommendations are delivered. This lack of transparency makes it difficult and in some cases impossible for stakeholders affected by control to question the scientific basis of decision making, leading to controversy and even to less effective control [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Accordingly we introduce a user-friendly interface to our model, enabling the effects on control performance of changes to disease spread and control parameters to be explored, which as we demonstrate here can include applying the model to different pathosystems. By allowing for an ensemble of simulation runs with identical parameters, this &#x02018;front-end&#x02019; also allows stochastic variability to be visualised. The front-end is available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.webidemics.com/">http://www.webidemics.com/</ext-link> (Webidemics is a backronym: (WEB)-based (I)nteractive (D)emonstration of (E)pidemiological (M)odelling (I)nforming (C)ontrol (S)trategies). The Webidemics interface demonstrates the challenges inherent in optimising control strategies that account for cryptic infection, stochasticity and uncertainty in parameter values.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Host landscape</title><p>Our model readily accommodates an arbitrarily complex host landscape, from regular geometrical patterns typical of agricultural and horticultural crops, to random and clustered patterns typical of plant hosts in natural environments. With that generality in mind, we illustrate the approach for a random host landscape typical of urban Florida, with 2000 trees randomly distributed on a 2km x 2km square at a plausible density for dooryard citrus (i.e. trees in residential gardens) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We note our Webidemics interface also accommodates a citrus grove (the colloquial term for what is also referred to as a &#x0201c;citrus orchard&#x0201d;), with 2016 hosts in two adjacent blocks, planted in rows 10m apart and with a 5m within-row host spacing, reflecting standard practice in the U.S. citrus industry. For brevity all results presented in this paper for citrus canker correspond to the random host landscape (note, however, that our application of the model to HLB considers disease spread through the citrus grove host landscape).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Epidemiological model</title><p>We use a spatially-explicit, stochastic, individual-based, compartmental model to represent the spread of a plant pathogen through a population of <italic>N</italic> hosts (<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>). Hosts are categorised by disease status: (S)usceptible hosts are uninfected; (E)xposed hosts are latently infected, and so are neither symptomatic nor infectious; (C)ryptic hosts are infectious but still asymptomatic; (D)etectable hosts are symptomatic but not infectious; (I)nfected hosts are both infectious and symptomatic; and (R)emoved hosts are epidemiologically inert, either because of disease-induced death or because the host has been removed by any control effort. The Webidemics interface allows the timing of the cryptic and detectable classes to be exchanged, with visible symptoms either preceding or following the onset of infectiousness, and therefore can represent any of the SECI, SEDI, SECIR and SEDIR epidemic models [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Here, motivated by the biology of citrus canker [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], we concentrate exclusively on the SECI and SECIR variants of the model, in which detectable symptoms strictly follow infectiousness. This is the case in which control is most difficult, since it is hampered by invisible cryptic infection. We note that, although citrus canker does not itself directly kill host plants, accounting for control requires there to be a removed compartment in the model, as does allowing the user of our Webidemics interface to apply the model to host-pathosystems for which there is disease-induced host death.</p><p>In the absence of control, the E to I and C/D to I transitions occur at fixed rates &#x003b3; and &#x003c3;, and so waiting times in these compartments are exponentially distributed, with means 1/&#x003b3; and 1/&#x003c3;, respectively (see <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This assumption could of course readily be relaxed to allow for other distributions of waiting times [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the SECIR and SEDIR variants of the model, the rate of disease-induced death is &#x003bc;, again with an exponentially distributed transition time (mean 1/&#x003bc;). For any given host plant, the rate of the S to E (susceptible to exposed) transition depends on the status of other hosts and the suitability of the environment for infection. In particular, if host <italic>i</italic> is susceptible at time <italic>t</italic> then it becomes latently infected (i.e. transitions to the E compartment) at rate

The host population is surveyed every 90 days [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], symptomatic hosts are detected with probability 0.8, and host removal occurs exactly 60 days after detection [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The default cull radius is set to be 75m; this default radius was chosen to emphasise the range of outcomes that is possible for a single control strategy, even when all parameters remain fixed. Epidemics are seeded with two exposed hosts at <italic>t</italic> = 0 (a different pair of hosts for each realisation). The average latent period is 10d [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and symptoms take an average of 110d to emerge following infection [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The dispersal kernel is exponential, with mean dispersal distance of 40m (i.e. <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = 20m), and we take the rate of secondary infection to be &#x003b2; = 0.03d<sup>-1</sup> (<italic>cf</italic>. the values of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = 37m and &#x003b2; = 0.036d<sup>-1</sup> as used in the analyses of Cook <italic>et al</italic>. and Parnell <italic>et al</italic>.

This allows us to present extensive sensitivity analyses to parameters that would be expected to make control more difficult (e.g. long cryptic periods, lengthy delays between detection and tree removal), without optimal controls degenerating to immediate removal of the entire population at the time of the first control for our rather small population of interest.

A pragmatic choice would therefore be to focus on a higher percentile of the distribution of &#x003ba;<sub><italic>E</italic></sub> when prescribing the control, with the particular percentile selected corresponding to the risk-aversion of the decision-maker. This approach can be formalised, by explicitly considering a risk of failure that is deemed to be acceptable (<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b</xref>). In particular, given a notion of an acceptable level of risk (e.g. at most a 10% chance of &#x003ba;<sub><italic>E</italic></sub> corresponding to the loss of more than &#x003a9; = 20% of hosts) a range of acceptable cull radii can readily be determined. A workable strategy would then be to select a cull radius near the centre of this range. Such a combination of criteria would lead to a prescribed cull radius of around 225m here (for the default parameters, p(Failure at risk = 20%) &#x0003c; 0.1 for 122m &#x0003c; <italic>L</italic> &#x0003c; 329m).</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Effects of epidemiological parameters and logistic factors on the efficiency of intervention strategies</title><p>For simplicity, we revert to using the median epidemic impact to summarise the efficacy of intervention, although we note the criterion could be readily adjusted as described above to suit different degrees of risk aversion. The optimal cull radius <italic>L</italic> is surprisingly unresponsive to the initial level of infection, E<sub>0</sub> (<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref>); the &#x0201c;correct&#x0201d; radius is virtually unaffected by the epidemic size when control starts. However, the corresponding epidemic impact increases very rapidly, and, for example, when only 2.5% of hosts are initially infected (uniformly at random), approximately 80% of hosts would eventually have to be removed before the pathogen was eradicated, even when controlling optimally. This confirms and quantifies the intuition that it is important to act quickly when confronted by a new outbreak, particularly if the initial infections are not clustered in space. The optimum cull radius and the performance when controlling optimally also depend strongly on the scale of pathogen dispersal (&#x003b1;) and the rate of secondary infection (&#x003b2;) (Fig <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g002" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g002" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>).</p><p>We illustrate typical decisions that must be made by policy-makers by focusing on the effect on control performance of a selection of four parameters that may be changed during the course of an eradication scheme (<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). These are the average cryptic period, (1/<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>), which may vary depending upon environmental conditions; the probability of detecting a symptomatic host (<italic>p</italic>), which may vary depending on the experience of the teams of observers; and the interval between successive surveys (<italic>T</italic>

<sub><italic>s</italic></sub> or <italic>T</italic>
<sub><italic>c</italic></sub> increase, or as <italic>p</italic> decreases, effective control becomes more challenging, and so the optimal cull radius and epidemic impact at this radius both increase. Particularly striking is that extreme changes to the probability of detection and average cryptic period are required for performance to degrade significantly. The influence of changes to either of these is mitigated by averaging over a large number of hosts: only a single host must become detectable or be detected for control to be initiated locally, and the resulting cull then affects many nearby hosts simultaneously. However, because the survey interval and the notice period both affect all hosts equally, more modest changes affect the success of control to a greater extent.</p><fig id="pcbi.1004211.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004211.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Effect of epidemiological and logistic factors on control.</title><p>(a),(c),(e) and (g): Responses of median epidemic impact (&#x003ba;<sub><italic>E</italic></sub>) to cull radius (<italic>L</italic>) for different values of probability of detection, <italic>p</italic> (a), the average cryptic period, 1/<italic>&#x003c3;</italic> (c), the interval between successive surveys, <italic>T</italic>

While such controls fail to keep up with the region of cryptic infection surrounding detected hosts and so do not effectively control the epidemic, a proportion of infected plants is detected and removed on each round of surveying, and this causes the epidemic to spread more slowly (because infected hosts are being removed and there are fewer susceptible hosts to infect). Slower spread then allows the pathogen to persist for longer, since it takes more time for the infection and eventual removal of hosts. For larger control radii, however, we note the epidemic time can be very small; the pathogen is eradicated very quickly, generally within one or two rounds of detection and control.</p><fig id="pcbi.1004211.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004211.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Local vs. global control.</title><p>(a) Epidemic time (&#x003c4;<sub><italic>E</italic></sub>); i.e. the time for the epidemic to be controlled, as a function of the cull radius <italic>L</italic>.

[<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] recently fitted a model of the type we use here to the dataset on the spread of citrus canker in Miami that we described in the Introduction (note this is also the dataset used by Cook <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). In common with Cook <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], Neri <italic>et al</italic>.

However these authors found only a small difference in model goodness of fit between the exponential and Cauchy kernels. Neri <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] suggest this partial lack of identifiability is driven by the effect of continual primary infection (i.e. infection from outside the study site, within which disease spread was mapped). At large distances from infected hosts, the small and slowly decreasing probability of infection that would be associated with Cauchy dispersal is very difficult to distinguish from the small and effectively unchanging probability that would follow an exponential kernel combined with a constant background rate of primary infection caused by fat-tailed dispersal from one or more distant sources of inoculum, or by anthropomorphic introduction of inoculum on implements, clothing or cuttings. The study sites were relatively small (&#x0003c;10km<sup>2</sup>) uncontrolled regions embedded within a large ongoing epidemic. A non-zero rate of primary infection from outside was necessary to fit the spread data in these sites, since there was significant ingress of infection from outside each site. Here, since we specifically target an isolated outbreak of emerging plant disease, far from any large source of inoculum, primary infection is not required in the analyses in the current paper. We accordingly set the rate of primary infection to zero throughout our analyses, and default to using an exponential dispersal kernel, for consistency with the fitting of Neri <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and Cook <italic>et al</italic>.

The striking difference in epidemic pattern suggests that effective control via local removal of hosts should be more difficult when there is Cauchy dispersal. For purposes of comparison, we therefore test the effect of fat-tailed dispersal on our analyses</p><p>At low infection rates, effective control remains possible even with thick-tailed dispersal. For the Cauchy kernel with scale parameter <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = 20m and infection rate <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> = 0.007d<sup>-1</sup>, good control can be achieved using a cull radius <italic>L</italic> = 100m (<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a</xref>), although the long tail of the epidemic impact distribution (Inset B) reveals large epidemics are possible even when controlling optimally. However, successful control requires a small infection rate, and only moderate increases to the infection rate <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> greatly increase both the minimum median epidemic impact &#x003ba;<sub><italic>E</italic></sub> and the cull radius, <italic>L</italic>, at which this optimum &#x003ba;<sub><italic>E</italic></sub> is achieved (<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5b</xref>). What responses of the median &#x003ba;<sub><italic>E</italic></sub> to <italic>L</italic> and <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> do not reveal, however, is how quickly the chance of a large epidemic increases as the infection rate goes up. For an infection rate <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> of only 0.01d<sup>-1</sup> there is a significant risk of failure of control, as indicated by the extremely variable distribution of epidemic impact for all control radii, even near the optimum cull radius <italic>L</italic> ~ 300m (<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5c</xref>). Indeed it is impossible to select a range of radii that leads to at most a 10% chance of losing less than &#x003a9; = 20% of hosts for this value of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> (see <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5d</xref> and contrast with <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref>), reiterating the relative difficulty of control when there is fat-tailed dispersal.

Taken together these observations suggest that successful control by culling may be difficult for plant pathogens that spread via windborne propagules which are tolerant to desiccation. These include powdery mildews and rust pathogens. Effective control of these pathogens is likely to require large local cull radius and could be expected to have relatively high risks of failure.</p><fig id="pcbi.1004211.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004211.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>The effect of thick-tailed dispersal.</title><p>(a) Response of the epidemic impact &#x003ba;<sub><italic>E</italic></sub> to the cull radius <italic>L</italic> with Cauchy dispersal and low infection rate (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> = 0.007d<sup>-1</sup>).

We have also introduced Webidemics, an interactive online tool designed to communicate principles affecting effective control to an audience of stakeholders, including policy makers, regulators, growers and scientists. Default parameterisation of the underlying epidemiological model targets the spread of citrus canker in Florida by adapting the parameters of previous modelling studies, although these defaults can readily be altered to represent other model parameterisations or even pathosystems by the user of our front-end interface. The analysis and the user-friendly interface address and illustrate the challenges posed by cryptic infection, stochasticity and uncertainty in parameter values, and demonstrate how these factors must be accounted for in designing successful disease control strategies.</p><p>Our key result is to verify that it is indeed possible to optimise control via targeted host removal by matching the &#x0201c;intrinsic scale of the epidemic&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], selecting a cull radius that minimises the epidemic impact, &#x003ba;<sub><italic>E</italic></sub> (i.e. the total number of hosts lost to disease or control before the pathogen is eradicated). However, given particular parameters controlling disease spread and the logistics of control, we have shown how the cull radius that would be selected depends on the percentile of the epidemic impact distribution that is to be optimised over, and therefore on the risk-aversion of the decision-maker. Since costs of disease are typically greater than costs of detection and control, under-control can be more harmful than over-control [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This is reflected in the sharp increase in epidemic impact, with even small decreases in the cull radius below the optimum (<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>), a pattern that is largely unresponsive to the values of the parameters (<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). The pattern also holds for other baseline sets of parameters (<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Text</xref>) and also when applying the model to other pathosystems (<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Text</xref>). We have also confirmed the intuition that control should start quickly to be successful; if even a small proportion of hosts is infected when intervention commences, a large epidemic impact appears unavoidable, particularly if the initial infections are not spatially-clustered (<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref>).</p><p>We investigated how the nature of the optimum control strategy is conditioned on a selection of parameters controlling the host-pathogen interaction and the logistics of control. Our results show how success of control depends strongly on the rate and spatial scale of pathogen spread (Fig <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g002" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g002" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). We also showed how factors that act differently at the level of the individual host can have less severe effects as they are altered than those that affect all individuals equally, as a consequence of the former being averaged over the entire population (<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). While control by local culling can remain viable when there is thick-tailed dispersal, control is only then successful for low infection rates (<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Even moderate rates of spread due to higher infection rates (&#x003b2;) lead to too many new disease foci when there is fat-tailed dispersal, and, in turn, this means that control is often unsuccessful, with significant risk of large epidemic impacts. This high risk of failure remains hidden if only the median epidemic impact is considered (<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5c</xref>), re-emphasising the need to examine the full distribution of outcomes when assessing the efficacy of control.</p><p>Our purpose here was to illustrate and test some key principles underlying the success of control. For this we selected a biologically-plausible set of parameters for citrus canker that allowed extensive sensitivity analyses to factors that are likely to affect the success of control. Our initial analyses focused on the optimal cull radius to eradicate disease in local outbreaks following a small number of primary infections in a spatially restricted (2km x 2km) urban host landscape. Our analyses show that the magnitude of the optimal cullradius depends upon the degree of risk aversion to failure of control, calculated from percentiles for the probability of a given epidemic impact that accounts for the cost of disease and the cost of control. Values for our default parameterisation for citrus canker varied from 104m for the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile of local epidemic impact to 194m for the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile, with an optimal radius of 159m when optimising over the median impact (<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). However, while the responses of epidemic impact to changes in the cull radius, and of the optimum cull radius to different levels of risk aversion, are both robust, the basic estimate of the optimal cull radius can vary widely (from ~100m to ~500m), depending on changes to epidemiological and logistical parameters (<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) and the underlying parameterisation selected for the model (<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Text</xref>).</p><p>All of these figures relate to local control and are typically smaller than the cull radius of 571.9m used by USDA for statewide control of the citrus canker epidemic in Florida from 2002 [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. One driver of this difference is that our default host landscape uses planting densities typical of residential citrus, whereas extended regions of commercial citrus would lead to faster spread due to higher planting densities. Moreover uncooperative landowners meant that in practice certain trees were inaccessible for pathogen survey, and legal challenges sometimes led to extremely long delays before other trees could be cut down. While both of these may be investigated via the front-end, our default parameters arguably downplay these effects (e.g. a fixed notice period of 60 days, when in practice legal challenges could lead to delays of many months or even years). More significantly, however, these initial estimates do not take account of the risk of infection spreading from the prescribed region of interest to surrounding regions. As we have shown here, to advance from optimisation at local to statewide scales in fact requires proper consideration of the balance between local and global impact of the epidemic (<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>).</p><p>Work targeting animal epidemics suggests optimal control strategies depend strongly on how local and global impacts are balanced [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We examined this by introducing two variants of the &#x0201c;epidemic cost&#x0201d;, that account for possible infections outside the area of interest via the proxies of local time to eradication or the probability of pathogen escape, but that are flexible enough to allow for different weightings of local vs. global priorities. Strategies giving a high weighting to global performance required extensive controls at the local level (Fig <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g004" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g004" ref-type="fig">4e</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.g004" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). This is because the potential for spread of disease to create a new focus of infection elsewhere is judged to be so harmful that it becomes optimal to use a rather draconian policy in the region under active control, even at the cost of many local removals.</p><p>While we motivate our analyses using citrus canker, our work can readily be placed in a broader context. The recent emergence of citrus greening or huanglongbing (HLB, caused by <italic>Candidatus Liberibacter</italic> spp. bacteria), potentially an even more devastating disease [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], puts control of citrus pathogens firmly back on the scientific and political agenda in the United States. HLB is vectored by psyllids, and although it would be reasonable to assume dispersal of infective vectors declines monotonically with distance from infected plants, it might be expected that changes in psyllid populations over time would add extra complexity to disease dynamics. However, recent work has shown how our underlying model focusing only on disease status and representing disease spread via a time-independent and spatially-isotropic dispersal kernel can be applied to this pathosystem with no change to the fundamental model structure [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We recreated a selection of our results for the control of HLB in a citrus grove in <xref rid="pcbi.1004211.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Text</xref>. We emphasise that using this type of model for HLB means that the activity and population dynamics of the psyllid population are not tracked explicitly, but instead that these factors are included in the dispersal and infection rate parameters of the model. The results concerning principles for control were qualitatively unchanged, although of course the exact detail of the optimum radius and epidemic impact were different reflecting a different pathogen and host topology.</p><p>Similar models are increasingly used for other plant pathogens at both small [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and large spatial scales [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. An emerging epidemic to which models are already being applied is sudden oak death (caused by <italic>Phytophthora ramorum</italic>) in the United Kingdom [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]: predictions from a larger-scale stochastic compartmental model are already informing the extent of felling of commercial larch [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The United Kingdom government&#x02019;s response to Chalara ash dieback is also based on predictions from this type of model [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Models with static hosts have also been applied to pathogens of agricultural animals, most notably for epidemics of foot and mouth disease.</p><p>Our particular focus has been a simple control strategy, in which all hosts within a certain distance of detected hosts are removed, and where this distance is fixed in advance. While this corresponds to the approach most often taken in practice, and has definite advantages in terms of ease of implementation and transparency to those affected by control, recent modelling work has examined more elaborate strategies. In particular te Beest <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] consider a complex and time-varying control strategy for an animal disease epidemic spreading through a set of farms that takes account of heterogeneity in the potential risk according to farms&#x02019; position and the current state of the epidemic. Our results are also conditioned on the metric used to define the epidemic impact. More complex notions of cost are possible; an obvious extension, for example, would be to include the cost of detection [<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1004211.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Although our model allows for fluctuations in environmental conditions and we allow the user to set parameters causing the pathogen to be affected by the environment via the front-end, we have not focused on these effects in this paper. We have also not accounted for the additional and significant difficulty in control of novel invasive pathogens for which the parameters controlling spread are themselves ill-characterised. Nor have we considered the effects of any spatial patterning of the host population in terms of, for example, systematic differences in host quality or differential resistance, although we note these spatial patterns would need to be well-characterised in order to be used in the model. We suggest that exploration of these issues, together with assessing and optimising the performance of control scenarios on spatially-extended host landscapes and particularly when there is thick-tailed dispersal, are important challenges. Further work is also underway to augment our theoretical work with interactive user-friendly front-end interfaces, after our extremely positive experiences in using the Webidemics interface to explain and present the ideas underlying our results to an audience of non-specialists.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1004211.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Information on the attempted eradication of citrus canker from Florida between 1996 and 2006.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1004211.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1004211.s002"><label>S2 Text</label><caption><title>Application of the model to a vectored pathogen: control of an isolated outbreak of huanglongbing disease in commercial citrus.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1004211.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1004211.s003"><label>S3 Text</label><caption><title>Results for citrus canker using the dispersal scale and infection rate parameters as presented by Cook <italic>et al</italic>.
