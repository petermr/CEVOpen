 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evaluation of lipid peroxidation (LPO) was performed using thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. Trichloroacetic acid (20%) was mixed with defrosted plasma, and the residual was reacted with 0.05 M sulfuric acid (H
  <sub>2</sub>SO
  <sub>4</sub>). 2-thiobarbituric acid was then mixed with the solution, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min in boiling water bath. Extraction of the final solution was performed with n-butanol, and the absorbance was measured at 532 nm (ELISA reader, Biotek, Germany).[
