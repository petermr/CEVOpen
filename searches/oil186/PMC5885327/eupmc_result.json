    "Pelargonium roseum Willd. (Geraniaceae) is widely grown as an ornamental plant due to its strong pleasant rose-like odor. The present study evaluates the antitrichomonal effect of P. roseum essential oil (EO) against Trichomonas gallinae both in vitro and in vivo and compares it to that of metronidazole (MTZ) as a standard antitrichomonal drug.In vitro assays were accomplished in multi-well plates containing MTZ and EO at final concentrations of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 μg/mL. In vivo assay was carried out on 40 experimentally infected pigeons receiving MTZ and EO at doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg.The 24-hr MIC of MTZ was 10 µg/mL, while for EO it was 20 µg/mL. Treatment with MTZ 50 mg/kg after 4 days led to full recovery of infected pigeons however EO 50 mg/kg resulted in the same outcome after 5 days. No mortality or clinical side effects were seen in treated birds.The present study introduced P. roseum EO as a potent natural antitrichomonal agent effective against T. gallinae. Bioactive components of P. roseum can be used as potential therapeutic compounds in development of novel antitrichomonal drugs."
