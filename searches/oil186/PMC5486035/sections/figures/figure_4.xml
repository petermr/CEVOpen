 <p> Cytoprotective effects of HEO on tert-butyl hydroperoxide ( t-BOOH) treated lymphocytes. Lymphocytes plus 100 μM of t-BOOH were incubated for 24 h in the absence (b) or in the presence of 20, 17.5, 15, 12.5, 10, 7.5, 5, or 1 μg/mL of essential oil (c–l, respectively). Lymphocytes incubated under the same experimental condition without t-BOOH (a). Cell vitality and integrity were analysed by trypan blue staining ( A) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release ( B). The asterisks (**) indicate significant differences ( p &lt; 0.05). Each value represents mean ± SD ( n = 3). </p>)
