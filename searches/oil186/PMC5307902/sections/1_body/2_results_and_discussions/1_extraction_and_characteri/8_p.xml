<p>Generally, oil yield and chemical composition are taxon-dependent and are strongly influenced by several factors, including harvest date, storage, environment, stage of maturity, and tested plant parts.[
 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Therefore, the products marketed are usually obtained from pools of several oil charges to achieve some uniformity. Nevertheless, comparing the results obtained in this work with the literature, it could be observed that there are similarities among some quality parameters analyzed, such as: relative density, refractive index, and solubility in ethanol.[
