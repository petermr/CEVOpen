<p>The last decade has seen increased interest in the use of essential oils from plants in the food, human health, and the pharmaceutical industry [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Different parts of plants can synthesize essential oils with diverse pharmacological activities, ranging from the cytotoxic, through the antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antiparasitic, to the anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Their antibacterial activity makes essential oils suitable alternatives to antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Many antibiotics can be not effective as bactericidal agents due to drug-resistancy of bacteria that have developed from the widespread use of antibiotics. Essential oils can be used as natural food preservatives against food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. They may be an alternative to currently used synthetic compounds, which may have toxic effects and may be carcinogenic [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oils is associated with different functional groups and the synergistic, antagonistic, or additive effects between them [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Essential oils may also play an important role in scavenging free radicals which may lead to oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) may induce the inflammation [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The inflammation is connected with many neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and other nervous pathogenesis [
