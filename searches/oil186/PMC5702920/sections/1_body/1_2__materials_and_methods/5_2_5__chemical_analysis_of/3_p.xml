<p class="p">Linear retention indices were calculated by injection of a series of
 <italic class="italic"> n</italic>-alkanes (C
 <sub class="sub">7</sub>–C
 <sub class="sub">26</sub>) [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] using the same column and conditions as described above for GC analyses. Peak identification was performed by comparison with chromatograms and retention times obtained previously by our group [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>].
