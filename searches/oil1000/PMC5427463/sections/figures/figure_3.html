 <p> Allelopathic effects of S. officinalis essential oil on T. aestivum, R. sativus, S. lycopersicum and T. foenum-graecum seedlings. (A) Radicle length, (B) Hypocotyls length, (C) Fresh radicle weight and (D) Fresh hypocotyls weight. The values in the graphs represent the mean of twenty fives replications ± standard error. Comparison of treated and untreated seeds tested by SoEO yielded a significant interaction (p &lt; 0.01) between tested species and conditions (with or without SoEO). </p>
