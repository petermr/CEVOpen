    "Brewer's spent grain (BSG) is a promising substrate for the production of biocontrol fertilizer (BF). The effects of temperature, water content and fermentation time on the conidiation and germination rate of the entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana (BbQLU1) were modeled in a 3 × 3 × 3 factorially designed experiment. The optimum conditions for BF production (60% water content at 25 °C for 12 days) resulted in a conidiation of 0.85 × 108 spores/g and a germination rate of 98.68%. BF at a concentration of 1 × 10-2 g/ml prompted plant growth and exhibited high toxicity against Galleria mellonella with an LT50 of 3.6 days. GC-MS analysis found 2-piperidone; benzoic acid, 3-methyl-, methyl ester; and other compounds to be potentially related to the toxicity and enhanced plant growth. These findings provide substantial evidence to support the production of BF."
