<p class="p">The essential oils of air-dried hairy roots and roots of soil-grown plants (about 50 g of each) were obtained by hydrodistillation, using a Clevenger-type apparatus for 5 h. Chemical analysis of essential oils composition was performed by GC-MS method using a Trace GC Ultra apparatus (Thermo Electron Corporation, Milan, Italy) with FID and MS DSQ II detectors and MS-FID splitter (SGE, Analytical Science). The analysis conditions (column, temperatures, etc.) were as previously reported [
