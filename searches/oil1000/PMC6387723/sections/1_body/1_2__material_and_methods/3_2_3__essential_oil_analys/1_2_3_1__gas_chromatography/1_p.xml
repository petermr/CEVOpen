<p class="p">The composition of volatile constituents of the essential oil was analyzed using a gas chromatograph 6890N (Agilent Technologies, USA) equipped with a 5973 INERT mass selective spectrometer (ionization energy 70 eV) and an HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 270°C, and held at 270°C for 10 min. The samples were injected as mentioned above. Components were identified by comparing retention indices relative to C8–C20 n-alkanes, and the mass spectra were compared with the mass spectra from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library and the reference data [
