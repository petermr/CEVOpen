<p id="Par7" class="p">The results obtained during the investigation of the microbiological characteristics of the fermented fish flours produced have indicated a significant reduction of microbial quantum in the fermented fish flours produced by the adjunction of essential oil. These results underlined the high antimicrobial potential of essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Pimenta racemosa</italic>. Several studies have also reported the high antimicrobial potential of this essential oil. Indeed, Burt [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>] reported that the essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">Pimenta racemosa</italic> exhibited strong antibacterial activity on 
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic> O 157: H7. The strong antimicrobial activity of this essential oil, could be due to the presence in the oil of the main component with high antimicrobial activity such as eugenol. Indeed, eugenol is a remarkably versatile molecule incorporated as a functional ingredient in numerous products and has found application in the pharmaceutical, agricultural, fragrance, flavour, cosmetic and various other industries. Its vast range of pharmacological activities has been well-researched and includes antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-oxidant and anticancer activities. In addition, it is widely used in agricultural applications to protect foods from micro-organisms during storage. Singh [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>] revealed that eugenol has inhibited the growth of Gram-positive (
 <italic class="italic">Bacillus cereus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">B. subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) and Gram-negative (
 <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella typhi</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>) bacteria. According to the same authors, this inhibition was high in comparison to ampicillin (1 mg/mL) used as a positive control.
