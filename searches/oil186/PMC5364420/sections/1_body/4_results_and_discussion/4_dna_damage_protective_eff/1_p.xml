<p>The protection effects of the essential oil from 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> rhizomes on DNA oxidative damage induced by Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> and AAPH were evaluated and the results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>. Supercoiled plasmid DNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, lane 1) was prone to oxidation by hydroxyl radicals or peroxyl radicals generated by AAPH, which resulted in the formation of open circular (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, lane 2). From the gel analysis, similar results were found in protective effect assay of DNA from oxidative damage of Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> and AAPH. The essential oil showed effective and concentration dependent reduction in the formation of nicked DNA and increased super coiled form of DNA. In concentration range from 20 to 100 μg/mL, the protective effects of the essential oil against DNA damage induced by Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> and AAPH increased rapidly from 5.5% to 41.5% and from 10.4% to 58.0%, respectively. However, no significant change was found with the increase of concentration. These findings showed that the essential oil from 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> rhizomes owned a higher potential to prevent DNA damage. Nonetheless, essential oil exhibited stronger protection effects of DNA oxidative damage induced by AAPH than Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>, which may come from different determination method
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. The results of DNA oxidative damage induced by Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> indicated that the essential oil might prevent the Fenton’s reaction, and or it probably quenched hydroxyl radicals by donating hydrogen-atom or electron
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, while the other showed that the essential oil had the scavenging activity on peroxyl radicals generated by AAPH.
