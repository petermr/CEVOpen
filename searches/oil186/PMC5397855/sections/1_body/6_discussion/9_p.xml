<p>This study showed the potential of garlic essential oil and main compounds to control the 
 <italic>T. molitor</italic> in starches and stored products. In order to prevent or retard the development of insecticide resistance, the toxicity and repellency effects of garlic essential oil and toxic compounds on 
 <italic>T. molitor</italic> show that can be used individually or mixture to management populations. The lethalities of diallyl sulfide and diallyl disulfide on 
 <italic>T. molitor</italic> may have advantages by their mode of action on this insect. These findings show that the compounds of garlic essential oil are a potential source of insecticidal compounds and warrants further exploration.
