<p>The reducing power of SoEO was determined on the basis of the method of Oyaizu (1986[
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]). 500 µL of different concentrations of SoEO (1 to 20 mg/mL) were added to 1.25 mL of phosphate buffer (200 µM, pH 6.6) and 1.25 mL of potassium hexacyanoferrate [K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe (CN)
 <sub>6</sub>] (10 %). After 20 min at 50 °C, trichloroacetic acid (1.25 mL, 10 %) was added and the mixture was centrifuged at 3000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes. Finally, 1.25 mL of the supernatant was mixed with 1.25 mL of distilled water and 0.25 mL of ferric chloride [FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>] (0.1 %). A blank was prepared under the same conditions. BHT was used as the positive control and reading was measured at 700 nm. The experiment was done in triplicate and repeated twice.
