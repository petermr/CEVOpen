This step was repeated many times to obtain a considerable volume of essential oil (10 mL), then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in sealed glass vials in a refrigerator at 4 °C prior to analysis. The density of the essential oil obtained was 0.96 (10 µL of essential oil weighted 9.6 mg).
