<p class="p">The GC analysis of AcEO was performed on an Agilent 5973 N GC-MS coupled to an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph fitted with an injector at 250 °C (Splitless mode) and equipped with an HP-5MS capillary column coated with 5% phenyl-methyl siloxane (30 m length × 0.25 mm internal diameter × 0.25 μm of film thickness, Agilent 19091S-433). The column pressure was set to 51.6 × 103 Pa. The oven temperature was held at 40 °C for 2 min, and then programmed to 250 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.1 ml/min. Diluted sample in diethyl ether was manually injected.</p>
