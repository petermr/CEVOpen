<p class="p">Sterols constitute the major fraction of the unsaponifiable matter in many oils. More than 40 phytosterols were identified; from them 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol account for more than 95% of total phytosterols dietary intake [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. They are of interest due to their antioxidant activity and beneficial impact on human health [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The sterol content of
 <italic class="italic"> L. kerstingii</italic> seed oil is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab5" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. The total sterol content was 929.50 mg/kg of oil. 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-Sitosterol was the major form (93%), followed by campesterol (7%). The presence of high 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-sitosterol was found to limit TG polymer formation in triolein, refined canola, high oleic sunflower, and flaxseed oils heated at frying temperature [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. This suggests that
 <italic class="italic"> L. kerstingii</italic> seed oil could be used as frying oil.
