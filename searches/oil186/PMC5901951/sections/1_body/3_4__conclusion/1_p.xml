<p>This work was to identify potential of oil resources extracted from trees and fat-soluble nutrients, and their physicochemical features were investigated. As for nutrients, all the tree-borne seed oils except JCT oil had high levels of unsaturated fat (&gt;80%) and the tree-borne seed oils had variable contents of tocopherol, fat-soluble vitamins, and phytosterols (plant sterols). For physicochemical features, acid values and POVs for the primary oxidation product were stable in all seed oils except MPA oil, and 
 <italic>p</italic>-AV, the indicator for secondary oxidation products, was also identified. For browning intensity and color scale, it was difficult to conclude freshness because the values from these tests also contained oil's own color scale; however, these tests provided fundamental information about color scale. As for the oxidation-induction period, the indicator of oxidative stability, results varied depending on the level of unsaturated fatty acids and 
 <italic>α</italic>-T, fat-soluble antioxidant. This study demonstrated that the chain length and rate of unsaturation in fatty acids can be a parameter for the use of edible oils as a nutritional supplement, the content of each tocopherol acting as antioxidant agent, and the phytosterol in tree-borne seed oils as cholesterol-lowering agent in our body. Physicochemical results in this study will be useful parameters for the refining process of tree-borne seed oils in industrial applications.
