 <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] The 2-day-old mycelia from 50 mL PDB were collected and centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min. Then, the samples are lyophilized. About 0.1 g of dry mycelia were homogenized with liquid nitrogen and extracted with 4.0 mL of methanol: chloroform: water mixture (2:1:0.8, v/v/v) with vigorous shaking for 30 min. The resulting sample was centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min. The lower phase containing lipids was mixed with 0.2 mL saline solution and centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min. To the lipid mixture add 0.2 mL chloroform and 0.5 mL of H
