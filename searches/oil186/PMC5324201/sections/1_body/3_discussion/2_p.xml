<p class="p">The oil from a single source has not been found to be suitable for consumption and medicinal preparation because of their different chemical compositions. So, the necessity for searching of new oil source is a major research interest in the present day. Our previously published data on the fatty acid composition of 
 <italic class="italic">Anethum sowa</italic> seed and flower part [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>] revealed that oleic acid was the highest in seed (87.10%) and flower (51.93%) part than our current study. Moreover, palmitic acid content is almost similar to the flower fatty acid (30.74%) but it is found higher than the seed (4.27%) fatty acid. Linoleic acid is one of the essential polyunsaturated fatty acids which prevents cardiovascular diseases and its derivatives serve as structural components of the plasma membrane [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]. It also has a beneficial effect on blood lipids, lowering blood pressure and serum cholesterol. The nutritional value of linoleic acid is due to its metabolism at the tissue levels, which produced the hormone-like prostaglandins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. It was found the second highest fatty acid in the present study. The saturated fatty acids like lauric, myristic and palmitic acid have been established as the most important of the dietary risk factors and resulted in a high level of total blood cholesterol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]. Diets with a PUFA:SFA ratio was found the below of 0.45, which considered inadequate because of their potential to increase blood cholesterol levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>]. On the other hand, higher SFA stimulates the 
 <italic class="italic">de nova</italic> synthesis of cholesterol in the body. Thus, it indicates that these are not a good source of fatty acids for human health. Moreover, TI was found higher than 1 in cold and hot extracted fatty acids while AI was found higher than 1 in cold extracted fatty acid, but the lower value was found in hot extracted fatty acids. The AI and TI indexes have considered as cardiovascular disease risk factors. Thus, these indices must be kept low. It was reported that lower AI leads to a decrease in the total cholesterol and the LDL-cholesterol in human blood plasma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]. To the best our knowledge, this is the first report regarding the fatty acids of 
 <italic class="italic">A. sowa</italic> root. This investigation has given us valuable information about the structure of the fatty acids and also indicated that these oils cannot be considered as functional ingredients of human diet but it may be a valuable source for the cosmetic or industrial application.
