    "Nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiO NPs) have attracted increasing attention owing to potential capacity to penetrate to several human cell systems and exert a toxic effect. Elsewhere, the use of medicinal plants today is the form of the most widespread medicine worldwide. Utilizing aromatic plants as interesting source of phytochemicals constitute one of the largest scientific concerns. Thus this study was focused to investigate antioxidant and cytoprotective effects of essential oil of a Mediterranean plant P. lentiscus (PLEO) on NiO NPs induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress in human lung epithelial cells (A549). The obtained results showed that cell viability was reduced by NiO NPs, who's also found to induce oxidative stress in dose-dependent manner indicated by induction of reactive oxygen species and reduction of antioxidant enzymes activities. Our results also demonstrated that PLEO contains high amounts in terpinen-4-ol (11.49%), germacrene D (8.64%), α-pinene (5.97%), sabinene (5.19%), caryophyllene (5.10%) and δ-Cadinene (4.86%). PLEO exhibited a potent antioxidant capacity by cell viability improving, ROS scavenging and enhancing the endogenous antioxidant system against NiO NPs in this model of cells. The present work demonstrated, for the first time, the protective activity of PLEO against cell oxidative damage induced by NiO NPs. It was suggested that this plant essential oil could be use as a cells protector."
