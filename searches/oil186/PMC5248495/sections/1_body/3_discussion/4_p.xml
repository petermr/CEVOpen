 <italic>O. thyrsiflora</italic> varieties of basil show high inhibition rates against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacteria, which makes it possible to consider using these oils as active natural ingredients for the treatment of skin irritations, since 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> is extremeley common on the skin of patients with certain dermatological diseases [
