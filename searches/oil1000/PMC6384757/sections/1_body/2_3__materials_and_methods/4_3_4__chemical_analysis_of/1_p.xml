<p class="p">The GC-MS system (Agilent, Little Falls, DE, USA) was composed on a 5975 mass selective detector and a 6890 GC. The GC capillary column was an Agilent HP-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). The injector and detector temperatures were 220 and 260 °C, respectively. The oven temperature was held at 45 °C for 5 min, increased to 250 °C with a flow rate of 3 °C /min, and then held for 10 min. A 1 μL aliquot of sample was injected in the split mode with a ratio of 1:10. Helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. </p>
