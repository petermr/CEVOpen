<p class="p">The GC-FID analysis of the EO was performed with a gas chromatograph Clarus 480 (Perkin Elmer, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector and an Elite-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>m; PerkinElmer, USA). The oven temperature was programmed as mentioned above. The detector and injector temperatures were 280°C and 220°C, respectively. The carrier gas was helium (99.99%) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Essential oil samples (2 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>L) were injected using the split mode. The percentage composition of EO was calculated using the peak normalization method.
