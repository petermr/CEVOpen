The six species of <italic>Chimonanthus</italic> are further classified into aromatic type and nonaromatic type according to whether their leaves release aroma or not. (Zhang and Shen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1999</xref>). Three species of <italic>Chimonanthus salicifolius</italic> S. Y. Hu, <italic>Chimonanthus Zhejiangensis</italic> M. C. Liu and <italic>Chimonanthus grammalus</italic> M. C. Liu are aromatic type (Zhang and Shen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1999</xref>). <italic>C. salicifolius</italic> S. Y. Hu, an endemic species of China, has been used as Chinese traditional medicine to therapy cough, vomiting, heatstroke, rheumatic arthritis and measles for thousands of years (Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2017</xref>). <italic>C. zhejiangensis</italic> M. C. Liu, only found in Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Fujian provinces, is also a Chinese herb and a courtyard ornamental plant, which is widely planted in the scenic area of Zhejiang province (Ouyang and Mai <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2010</xref>). <italic>C. grammalus</italic> M. C. Liu is an ancient angiosperm and a transitional species between <italic>Chimonanthus</italic> and <italic>Neochimonanthus</italic>, and is an endangered and national-protected medicinal plant in China and mainly distributed in Anyuan and Huichang counties of Jiangxi Province (Jiang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">b</xref>). The three <italic>Chimonanthus</italic> plants mostly distributed in the area where &#x02018;She&#x02019; ethnic minority lived in, so the tender stems were firstly applied by them as a traditional herb to treat cough and rheumatism for a long time, and the Chinese name of the galenical is Shiliangcha (herb tea) (Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2017</xref>). To date, the three species of <italic>Chimonanthus</italic> have been made into herbal beverage named as &#x02018;Gold tea&#x02019;, a type of healthy decoction in the counties around Zhejiang, Fujian and Jiangxi provinces.</p><p id="Par9">In order to identify the bioactive components, both volatiles and non-volatiles of wintersweet plants were taken into account. The non-volatiles of <italic>Calycanthaceae</italic> include alkaloid (Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">b</xref>), terpene (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>), flavone (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2017</xref>), coumarin (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2016</xref>) and so forth. The volatiles of wintersweet plants were essential oil, which can be used as cosmetics, perfumery and aromatherapy. The aromatic type species of <italic>Chimonanthus</italic> usually release large quantity of volatiles and abundant terpenes (terpenoids) as &#x003b2;-caryophyllene, &#x003b2;-elemene, &#x003b3;-elemene, germacrene-D, trans-&#x003b2;-ocimene, sabinene, &#x003b4;-cadinene were found in essential oils (Lv et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2012</xref>; Farsam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2007</xref>). Phytochemical analyses have revealed that they were not only rich in essential oils but also in semi-volatile fractions. Recently, squalene was identified in the volatile oil of <italic>C. salicifolius</italic> by GC&#x02013;MS (Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2013</xref>). We also found squalene in the extractions of leaves of <italic>C. zhejiangensis</italic> detected by GC&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;GC-TOFMS method in this work. Squalene, a triterpene with a formula of C<sub>30</sub>H<sub>50</sub> including six isoprene units, is an important intermediate of the endogenous synthesis of cholesterol in animals or sterol in plants. It is ubiquitous and has been detected in bacteria, alga and mammals. In 1935, the first higher plant-derived squalene was gained from olive oil (Thorbjarnarson and Drummond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1935</xref>). Up to now, squalene has been isolated in more plants as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> (Nakashima et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1995</xref>; Kribii et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1997</xref>; Genova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2014</xref>; Uchida et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">Terpene or terpenoid is the largest class of secondary metabolites in plants, and it is synthesized by either the mevalonate pathway (MVA) in the cytosol or the methylerythritol phosphate pathway (MEP) in plastids (Jiang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">b</xref>). Squalene is synthesized in the triterpene biosynthesis pathway, a branch of the terpene biosynthetic network of MVA pathway in plants (Chappell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2002</xref>). It is generated from two molecules of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) in a two-step reductive dimerization reaction catalyzed by squalene synthase (SQS) (Pandit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2000</xref>). The next metabolism step is that squalene is cyclized to lanosterol followed by many enzymatic steps for the conversion to cholesterol (Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2000</xref>). SQS is the key enzyme of squalene metabolism, and the genes have been isolated in animals, plants and bacteria (Pandit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2000</xref>; Jiang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">b</xref>; Dale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>; Okada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2000</xref>). SQSs from eukaryotic organisms are associated with the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) membranes through a hydrophobic membrane-spanning &#x003b1;-helix located at the C-terminus of the protein. In contrast, bacterial SQSs lack of the C-terminal &#x003b1;-helix, and are not affiliated with the membrane (Stamellos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1993a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">b</xref>). The SQSs have been studied deeply in many organisms including <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, tobacco and human. In contrast, squalene was found in <italic>C. zhejiangensis</italic>, a traditional Chinese herb, but our knowledge on the molecular basis of squalene biosynthesis in which is absent. Here, we further confirmed squalene generation in the leaves of wintersweet, isolated the squalene synthase gene of <italic>C. zhejiangensis</italic> and identified its enzymatic activity, to give a complete explanation on the squalene biosynthesis in wintersweet.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant materials</title><p id="Par11">Three species of wintersweet: <italic>Chimonanthus salicifolius</italic> S.

Their buds and leaves have been applied as a traditional herb by the &#x02018;She&#x02019; ethnic minority people that distributed in the southeast of China. The pharmacology studies of wintersweet have revealed that its volatile or non-volatile compounds has phytochemical functions as anticonvulsion, abirritation, inhibiting cancer cells and anti-mycobacteria (Chebib et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2003</xref>; Amador et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2000</xref>; Verotta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2002</xref>; Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">b</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2011</xref>; Yu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2014</xref>). It was reported that 35.97% of the volatile compounds of wintersweet was sesquiterpenoids, and so the essential oil has anti-bacteria and free radical scavenging functions (Yu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2014</xref>). In this paper, we analyzed the volatiles and non-volatiles compounds in leaves of wintersweet by SPME and GC&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;GC-TOFMS methods, respectively. Totally, 54 volatile terpenoids including 25 monoterpenoids and 29 sesquiterpenoids were detected in the leaves of <italic>C. zhejiangensis</italic> by SPME. The contents of eucalyptol, &#x003b2;-myrcene and pinene were the highest in monoterpenoids, and germacrene D, cadina-1(10), 4-diene and copaene were the highest in sesquiterpenoids. In the concentrated extractions of <italic>n</italic>-hexane, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate, up to 104 terpenes or terpenoids were identified and some of them were also included in the volatiles detected by the SPME (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Tables S1 and S2). Our result was similar to other studies that the terpenes or terpenoids were the major compounds of the wintersweet plants. Besides large quantity of monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids, we also found squalene in the extractions of leaves of <italic>C. zhejiangensis</italic> and which has been confirmed in one species of wintersweet (Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par24">Squalene is taken part in the ergosterol biosynthetic process, sterol biosynthetic process and terpene metabolism. Squalene synthase (SQS), the farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyl transferase, catalyzes two molecules farnesyl diphosphate to form squalene. SQS is the key enzyme of the ergosterol, sterol and terpene metabolism. Here, we cloned SQSs from three wintersweet plants and identified the function in vitro for the first time. The subcellular location of AtSQS1 is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Busquets et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>). The CzSQS, CgSQS, CsSQS transmembrane regions were similar to AtSQS1 based on the sequences alignment and the TMHHM analysis (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2). The subcellular of the wintersweet SQS was like the AtSQS1, they locate on the ER. The active site of domain A, combining the two FPP into PSPP and loosen one pyrophosphate (Gu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1998</xref>), is Try. These sites are the same among the three wintersweet plants SQS. The different five sites of the three wintersweet plants SQS was absent of the active site. In domain B, binding the diphosphate moiety of the allylic substrates via an Mg<sup>2+</sup> bridge (Gu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1998</xref>), the active domain is DXXXD that binding prenyl diphosphate. The different amino acid residues of the three wintersweet plants SQSs are absent in DXXXD. The other different sites were not in the active domain (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1).</p><p id="Par25">In view of highly conserved sequences and homology-based structural modeling result, we just performed the enzymatic analysis for CzSQS.

In vitro enzyme reactions manifested that CzSQS-pEXP5-CT/TOPO encoded a functional squalene synthase. Squalene is spotlighted by its biofunction in clinic usage, such as antioxidant, antitumor, and cyto-protective effects (Kim and Karadeniz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>). While the function of squalene from wintersweet plants was deficiency.
