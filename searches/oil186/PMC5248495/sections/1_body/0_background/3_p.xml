 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] named four major chemotypes of basil: methyl chavicol-rich, linalool-rich, methyl eugenol-rich, and methyl cinnamate-rich. Both methyl chavicol and methyl eugenol are phenylpropanoids produced by shikimic acid pathway and are reported to be toxic to insects and microbes. Linalool is a terpenoid produced by mevalonic acid pathway and known to possess antioxidant and antimicrobial activity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] the European basils are mostly of linalool and methyl chavicol types, whereas tropical basils have methyl cinnamate as their major constituent. Basils of methyl eugenol chemotype could be found growing in North Africa, Eastern Europe, and parts of Asia [
