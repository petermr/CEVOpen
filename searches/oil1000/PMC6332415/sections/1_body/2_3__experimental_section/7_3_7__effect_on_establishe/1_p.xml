The culture was diluted 1:20 in fresh BHI-1% NaCl plus 0.25% glucose at 37 °C. Two hundred microliters of this suspension were used to inoculate sterile 96-well-polystyrene microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). Following incubation, the biofilms were first washed five times with PBS, and then 200 μL of the essential oil prepared in BHI-1% NaCl plus 0.25% glucose were added to each prewashed and control wells. The microplates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, the wells were first washed five times with PBS and then 200 µL of PBS and 12 μL of XTT–menadione solution (12.5:1

The plate was then incubated for 3 h in the dark at 37 °C and the color change in the solution was measured with a Multiskan reader at 490 nm (BioRad, Tokyo, Japan). The absorbance values for the controls were then subtracted from the values of the tested wells to eliminate spurious results due to background interference. Each assay was repeated three times. In order to access the ability of the essential oil to treat preformed mature biofilms, the percentage of biofilm eradication was calculated using the equation:
