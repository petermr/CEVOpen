<p class="p">The 25923/activation/3.125mg/mL optimized derived model was determined at cutoff of 121%, using 25 PCs, characterized by a 20:69 (0.29) proportion between actives and non-actives. The non cross-validated model was characterized by Accuracy, MCC, Precision-Recall and ROC-AUC coefficients of 0.906, 0.826, 0.956 and 0.961, respectively. Model robustness by cross-validation was characterized by high values of Accuracy
