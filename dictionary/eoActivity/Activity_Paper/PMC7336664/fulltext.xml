It will compare efficacy and safety outcomes of a titrated dose (10&#x02009;mg/10&#x02009;mg/mL oral solution formulation, dose range 2.5&#x02009;mg/2.5&#x02009;mg&#x02013;30&#x02009;mg/30&#x02009;mg/day) against placebo. There is a 2-week patient-determined titration phase, using escalating doses of 1:1 THC/CBD or placebo, to reach a dose that achieves symptom relief with tolerable side effects. This is then followed by a further 2-week assessment period on the stable dose determined in collaboration with clinicians. The primary objective is to assess the effect of escalating doses of a 1:1 THC/CBD cannabinoid preparation against placebo on change in total symptom score, with secondary objectives including establishing a patient-determined effective dose, the change in total physical and emotional sores, global impression of change, anxiety and depression, opioid use, quality of life and adverse effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This will be the first placebo-controlled clinical trial to rigorously evaluate the efficacy, safety and acceptability of 1:1 THC/CBD for symptom relief in advanced cancer patients.

Palliative care aims to take a skilled, holistic approach to improve patients&#x02019; symptoms and quality of life. Whilst there is a range of analgesic medication available for pain management, the control of many other symptoms (e.g. fatigue, anorexia, weight loss) remains a challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">There has been increasing interest in the use of medicinal cannabinoids over recent years, particularly for the relief of symptoms in palliative care patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Recent legislative change in several Australian states provided pathways for the use of medicinal cannabinoids for a range of indications including chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), resistant epilepsy, pain and spasticity in multiple sclerosis, and symptoms associated with terminal illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">Cannabis contains almost 500 bioactive compounds, including over 70 different cannabinoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The predominant cannabinoids include delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is the main psychoactive component of cannabinoids and is thought to act as a partial agonist on the endocannabinoid system. Potential benefits of THC include analgesia, anti-nausea and muscle relaxation, with potential side effects including intoxication, psychosis, anxiety and sedation. The recommended dose range for oral THC varies from 2.5 to 40&#x02009;mg/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In contrast, CBD is not intoxicating and has a range of anxiolytic, antipsychotic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-convulsant and neuroprotective effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. CBD is also considered to mediate many of the adverse psychotropic effects of THC, although this research is still emerging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. CBD has been used with a dosing in the range of 40 to 1280&#x02009;mg/day orally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">There is little high-quality evidence of benefit to date for the use of medicinal cannabinoids. The most recent review from the USA National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found substantial evidence for the use of medicinal cannabinoids for treatment of some types of chronic pain, CINV and spasticity in multiple sclerosis in some patients, with moderate evidence for sleep disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Cannabinoid products are licenced for a range of conditions in different countries, with little consistency between countries for indication and dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Whilst cannabinoids may have clinical indication, their use is not without potential for substantial harms, and further research is needed to define their role in medical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">There are many unknowns when it comes to prescribing medicinal cannabis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This includes the formulation of the drug (ratios of THC or CBD), the dosing of the drug and the best route of delivery. Ongoing concerns remain around the uncertainty over the optimal formulation, toxicity and abuse potential. The 1:1 THC/CBD ratio used in formulations may deliver sufficient CBD to ameliorate the psychotoxic effects of THC but is unlikely to produce significant CBD therapeutic effects.</p><p id="Par47">To date, there has been no formal examination of the effect of different THC/CBD ratios. We will therefore compare efficacy and safety outcomes of a 1:1 THC/CBD formulation against placebo, with doses of both THC and CBD escalated to doses previously shown to be safe.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p id="Par48">This study aims to define the role of cannabinoids in the management of symptoms in patients with advanced cancer, who are receiving standard palliative care. The hypothesis is that medicinal cannabinoids will reduce the total symptom burden in these patients compared to placebo.</p><p id="Par49">The primary objective is to assess the effect of escalating doses of a 1:1 THC/CBD cannabinoid preparation against placebo on total symptom score at day 14 as measured by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) (change in score from baseline). Secondary objectives are to establish a patient-determined effective dose of a 1:1 THC/CBD formulation and assess the effect on symptom scores at days 7, 21 and 28. Other secondary objectives include assessing the change in total physical and emotional sores, global impression of change, anxiety and depression, opioid use and quality of life at the same time points and to document adverse effects associated with cannabinoid use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par50">This study is a pragmatic multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, two-arm parallel trial of escalating doses of oral THC/CBD 10&#x02009;mg/10&#x02009;mg/mL oral solution. There is a 2-week patient-determined titration phase, using escalating doses of a 1:1 THC/CBD combination or placebo, to reach a dose that achieves symptom relief with tolerable side effects. This is followed by a further 2-week assessment period on the stable dose determined in collaboration with clinicians.</p><p id="Par51">Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in equal numbers to one of the two study arms. Randomisation schedules will be developed for each site using random number tables, computer generated at an independent centre. Treatment for each patient will be allocated according to a permuted block randomisation schedule held by the central registry. Block randomisation within each centre will ensure even allocation to each arm in each site. The pharmacy will be notified of a participant, and a completed script with the participant&#x02019;s study ID number will be given to the site pharmacy. The pharmacist will randomise the participant according to the schedule and dispense the medication in a labelled bottle. The participant ID, allocation number, date of request, preparation and dispensing will be recorded in a log maintained by the site pharmacist for each randomisation.</p><p id="Par52">All participants, caregivers, investigators and clinical staff will remain blind to study assignment until trial completion. The code will only be broken in cases of a clinical emergency. An investigator not directly involved in the randomisation of patients will keep an un-blinded copy of the randomisation schedule and will be contacted in the event of the need to un-blind. All study drugs and placebo will be in oil solution form and identical in appearance. All oil solutions will be matched for taste, colour and bottle size to preserve the blinding irrespective of the contents; each participant will receive the oil solution in a prepacked bottle labelled with their individual trial participation ID number and consecutively numbered according to the randomisation scale.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par53">Cannabinoid oils, supplied by LG Pharma, will be used in this study. The decision to use oils was based on a number of factors including product availability, ability to access ongoing supplies, ability to produce matched placebo, regulations surrounding the production and transport of cannabinoid products and cost.</p><p id="Par54">Arm 1 of the trial consists of THC/CBD 10&#x02009;mg/10&#x02009;mg/mL oral solution (LG Pharma Pty Ltd) with a dose range of 2.5&#x02009;mg/2.5&#x02009;mg&#x02013;30&#x02009;mg/30&#x02009;mg/day and arm 2 a matching placebo oral oil solution. Participants are asked to take daily doses as per dosing schedule instructions. The study drug is to commence on the day of baseline assessment, continuing for a maximum of 28&#x02009;days.</p><p id="Par55">The cannabinoid oils and placebo will be dispensed in identical 50-mL bottles containing a sufficient quantity of oil. Bottles are to be stored at room temperature (25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) until used and stored away from light. The product will be dispensed from bottles with a wadded child-resistant cap. Participants will be given replacement bottles to complete the study as required. Participants will be educated on how to administer daily doses using supplied 1-mL syringes appropriate for the dose. The participant will complete a daily dosing schedule diary at home to record medication taken. Cannabinoid oil that has been allocated to a participant and not used will be returned to the research nurse/research officer and destroyed by the local pharmacy as per pharmacy guidelines.</p><p id="Par56">Dose titration will be confirmed following regular consultation. Each participant will be advised to increase their dose according to a schedule every 2&#x000a0;days until they are satisfied with their symptom improvement or they experience unacceptable side effects. Dose titration downwards will also be allowed, in consultation with research staff. The participant in collaboration with research staff will define the dose level at which they will continue until the primary outcome point (14&#x02009;days). Participants will then be given the option of remaining on the blinded oil solution for a further 2&#x02009;weeks (28&#x02009;days total) for continuing assessment of efficacy and adverse events (continue final dose if perceived to be of benefit and tolerated). Assessment at 28&#x02009;days following 14&#x02009;days of stable dose is a secondary end point.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study setting</title><p id="Par57">Participants will be recruited from five sites within the Queensland Palliative Care Research Group (QPCRG). These five sites have been chosen from the QPCRG as they have an established research team including research support systems within Palliative Care and have previous experience in trial participation in this setting.

The sample size is based on previous work by Hui et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] who determined the minimal clinically important difference in the TSDS to be 5.7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As such, we have elected to use an improvement of the TSDS of &#x02265;&#x02009;6 as a clinically significant change. Stata software (StataCorp. 2013. Stata Statistical Software: Release 13. College Station, TX: StataCorp) was used to estimate the sample size.</p><p id="Par89">The superiority of arm 1 compared to placebo will be tested by comparing the response to each arm after 14&#x02009;days, relative to baseline.</p><p id="Par90">Descriptive analyses and frequency distributions will be generated from participants&#x02019; demographic and clinical characteristics, with all variables explored using graphical methods and summary statistics. For the primary outcome, generalised estimating equations with the appropriate link function will be developed to assess the effect of treatment adjusted for centre. For secondary outcomes, where measurements from individual subjects are recorded several times over the course of the study, change over time in the various secondary outcome measures will be assessed using mixed models, accounting for within-subject correlation and effects due to centre. For all statistical analyses, any influence of potential covariates, for example age, sex, type of cancer and disease severity, will be explored. This study is powered to detect superiority of arm 1 over placebo.</p><p id="Par91">An interim analysis will be performed after 50% participants have completed 14&#x02009;days of the trial. The analysis will be performed by an independent biostatistician blinded for the treatment allocation and reported to the investigators and the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The purpose of the interim analysis is primarily to monitor and ensure safety of participants rather than evidence of such benefit that early stopping of the trial is justified. AEs and SAEs will be stratified by type and severity. The frequency of AEs and SAEs will be compared between treatment groups using chi-square tests and logistic regression if indicated to adjust for any baseline differences between groups. Differences in baseline characteristics are not anticipated, as the randomisation process should ensure that the patient groups are similar at baseline. However, as the numbers at interim analysis will be relatively smaller, it is possible that differences may arise by chance. All baseline characteristics will be assessed and any imbalance addressed in the analysis.</p><p id="Par92">If the interim analysis shows a significant difference, the investigators and DSMB will be un-blinded to the study groups and make any stopping decision on the basis of the nature of any AEs and/or SAEs and ethical grounds, as well as consideration of any statistical differences between the groups.
