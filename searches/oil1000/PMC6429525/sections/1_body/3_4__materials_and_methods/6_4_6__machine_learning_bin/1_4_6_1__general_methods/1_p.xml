<p class="p">All calculations were performed using the Python (version 3.6, 
 <uri xlink:href="https://www.python.org/" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.python.org/</uri>) programming language [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] by executing in-house code in the Jupyter Notebook platform (version 5.7) [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. The datasets were imported and loaded into a Pandas [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] dataframe and pre-processed to obtain four independent data matrices consisting of 89 rows (essential oil samples) and 54 columns (chemical components). Two dependent target vectors containing 89 biofilm production percentage observations at 48 μg/mL and 3.125 mg/mL were defined. Machine learning algorithms used in this study were implemented using the sklearn library (version 0.20) [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Unsupervised dimensionality reduction was performed with Principal component analysis (PCA) [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] while L2 regularized logistic regression was used for the supervised learning analysis. The scores and loadings relatives to the first two principal components (PCs) were graphically inspected on plots generated using the matplotlib library (version 3.0) [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. To build the classification models, 30 PCs were extracted for each dataset. Cross-validation was used to search for the optimal inhibition/activation percentage cut-off values in order to define active and inactive samples. The optimal cut-off values were used to obtain the hyper-parameters optimized classification models. The Hyper-parameters optimization was achieved through a Bayesian optimization [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-24-00890" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] of the number of PCs to be used as features and the regularization parameter of the L2-Logistic Regression (inverse of regularization strength in the sklearn implementation). For each dependent target vector two types of models were built: one to define EOs ability to inhibit biofilm production and another to describe biofilm production enhancement. Percentage ranges of 60–80% and 120–140% biofilm productions were chosen for inhibition and activation models, respectively. Finally, the most appropriate cut-offs for binary classification of biofilm inhibitors/not-inhibitors or biofilm enhancers/not-enhancers EOs were determined from a supervised learning analysis.
