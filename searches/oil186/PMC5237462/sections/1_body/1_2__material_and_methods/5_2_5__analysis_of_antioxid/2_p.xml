<p>A methanol solution of DPPH at the concentration of 40 
 <italic>μ</italic>g·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> was prepared. The essential oils were diluted in methanol concentrations (5, 1, 0.75, 0.50, and 0.25 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). For the evaluation, they were added into a test tube of 2.7 mL of the stock solution of DPPH, followed by addition of 0.3 mL of the essential oil solution. Meanwhile, the negative control was prepared, this being a mixture of 2.7 mL of methanol and the methanolic solution of evaluated compounds. After 30 minutes, the readings were taken in a spectrophotometer (Biospectro SP-22) at a wavelength of 517 nm. For comparison, ascorbic acid was evaluated.
