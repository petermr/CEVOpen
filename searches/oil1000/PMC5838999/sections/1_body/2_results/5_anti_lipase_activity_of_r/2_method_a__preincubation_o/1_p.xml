<p id="Par59" class="p">The aim of this method was to test, in an aqueous medium and in the absence of the substrate, the possible reactions between the pancreatic lipase and the inhibitor. The residual lipase activity was investigated at different concentrations of essential oil (0.05 to 2.00 mg/mL) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). As shown by the figure, a dose–response curve was obtained, with maximum inhibition (80%) achieved at 2.00 mg/mL of essential oil. The inhibitory activity of the essential oil expressed as IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value was about 0.22 ± 0.002 mg/mL, which is lower than that of pure THL (0.16 ± 0.001) used as a standard inhibitor against pancreatic lipase.
