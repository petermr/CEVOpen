<p>The species
 <italic> M. piperita</italic> has significant antioxidant activity and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 in the concentration of 100 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> with % AA 79.9 ± 1.6. The antioxidant activity is associated with the presence of linalool major compound (51.80%). The inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) by linear regression presented a value of 0.54 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, showing the strong coefficient correlation (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>) of 0.9770. On the other hand, if polar compounds, such as ascorbic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.12 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) compared to the essential oil, were only tested by it, they would be considered weak antioxidants.
