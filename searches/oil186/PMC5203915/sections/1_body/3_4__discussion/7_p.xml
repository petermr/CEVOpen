<p class="p">The essential oils from hairy roots and roots of soil-grown plants showed antimicrobial properties with higher antibacterial (MIC = 125–250 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL) than antifungal (MIC = 625–1250 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL) activities. The most susceptible bacteria strains were
 <italic class="italic"> Enterococcus faecalis </italic>(ATCC 29212) and
 <italic class="italic"> Pseudomonas aeruginosa </italic>(ATCC 27853) with a MIC value of 125 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL. However, no significant difference in susceptibility between Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria was found, although it is known that the latter are less sensitive to essential oils because their outer membrane contains hydrophilic lipopolysaccharides (LPS). LPS inhibits the penetration of membrane by the different hydrophobic compounds of the essential oils [

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Essential oils and their hydrophobic components may disrupt the bacterial cell membranes by separating the lipids leading to inhibition of the functional properties of the bacterial cell [

 <italic class="italic"> R. carthamoides </italic>root and rhizomes essential oil from commercial available material [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] but with lower activity against
 <italic class="italic"> E. faecalis </italic>(ATCC 29212) (MIC = 265 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL) and
 <italic class="italic"> P. aeruginosa </italic>(ATCC 27853) (MIC &gt; 512 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL) than the root essential oils in the present study (MIC = 125 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL). A pure compound is usually used as a bactericide if the MBC is no more than four times the MIC value [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] which was observed for
 <italic class="italic"> R. carthamoides</italic> HR and SGR essential oils. Therefore, these essential oils may be effective as bactericidal agents.
