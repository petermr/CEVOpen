<p class="p">The antioxidant ability of the spearmint oil was measured by the bleaching of a purple methanol solution of DPPH. This spectrophotometric assay uses the stable radical 2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) as a reagent. The IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> value for spearmint essential oil was 3 µg/mL in comparison to 11.5 µg/mL for the standard compound, BHT. Dhifi

 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> essential oil harvested from south of Tunisia (chemotype menthone/pulegone) was about 10 µg/mL. Some compounds such as as phenylpropanoids, monoterpenes, and oxygenated sesquiterpenes are reported to have oxidation inhibition capacity [
