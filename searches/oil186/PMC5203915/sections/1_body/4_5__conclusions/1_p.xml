<p>This is the first report that describes the chemical composition of
 <italic> Rhaponticum carthamoides</italic> essential oil from hairy roots, its antimicrobial potential, and the protective effect of this essential oil against LPS-induced inflammation and ROS production in astrocytes. The results show that
 <italic> R. carthamoides</italic> hairy roots may be used as a valuable source of essential oil and may represent an alternative to the roots of soil-grown plants. Our study suggests that
 <italic> R. carthamoides</italic> essential oil from hairy roots may be used as an effective natural antibacterial and antioxidant agent as food preservative and for the treatment of some infectious diseases. Moreover, the antineuroinflammatory properties of this essential oil give it potential as a complementary therapy in the prevention of some central nervous system diseases especially neurodegenerative ones. However, further research is needed to isolate the main compounds from hairy roots essential oil and to determine their biological activity.
