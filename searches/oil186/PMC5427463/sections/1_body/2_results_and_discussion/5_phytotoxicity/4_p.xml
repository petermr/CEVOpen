<p>The results obtained in this study clearly demonstrate that 
 <italic>S.officinalis </italic>essential oil from Eastern Center of Tunisia showed a high variation in its chemical composition compared to those isolated from other country regions. Moderate antioxidant activity of SoEO was demonstrated. This oil exhibited promising antimicrobial and antifungal activities and seems to have a potent fumigant activity against Lepidoptera and Coleoptera pests. Both phytotoxic and stimulating effects on 
 <italic>T. aestivum</italic>, 
 <italic>R. sativus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> and 
 <italic>T. foenum-graecum</italic> radicle and hypocotyl growth were observed. The high biological activities of 
 <italic>S. officinalis </italic>could be attributed to the components identified by GC-MS analysis. All those results valorize Tunisian 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> as a medicinal plant which can be a source of biological active compounds. Therefore, Tunisian 
 <italic>S. officinalis </italic>essential oil could be used as a natural agent in pest management, in cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.
