<p>The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (the concentration reducing 50 % of DPPH) obtained for scavenging activity on DPPH radical are shown in Table 2
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T2">(Tab. 2)</xref>. According to the recorded results, SoEO exhibited a good antioxidant power with an IC
 <sub>50 </sub>of 6.7 mg/mL but relatively lower than the synthetic antioxidant BHT used as positive control (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.2 µg/mL). The reducing power and the inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation of SoEO showed a mild to moderate activity compared to the positive controls (Table 2
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T2">(Tab. 2)</xref>). It seems that the antioxidant activity of sage oil is due to the presence of monoterpenes such as α-pinene, a known potent antioxidant (Wang et al., 2008[
 <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]) and several sesquiterpenes (Tamil Selvi et al., 2015[
 <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]) and it is assumed that the contribution of minor and major compounds exhibited this activity and not only one or few active molecules (Wang et al., 2008[
 <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]).
