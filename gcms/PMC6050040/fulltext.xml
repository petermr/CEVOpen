Balancing productive aggregation versus pathogenic aggregation that leads to toxicity is critical and known to involve adenosine triphosphate (ATP) dependent action of chaperones and disaggregases. Recently a second activity of ATP was identified, that of a hydrotrope which, independent of hydrolysis, was sufficient to solubilize aggregated proteins in vitro. This novel function of ATP was postulated to help regulate proteostasis in vivo. We tested this hypothesis on aggregates found in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte nucleoli. Our results indicate that ATP has dual roles in the maintenance of protein solubility. We provide evidence of endogenous hydrotropic action of ATP but show that hydrotropic solubilization of nucleolar aggregates is preceded by a destabilizing event. Destabilization is accomplished through an energy dependent process, reliant upon ATP and one or more soluble nuclear factors, or by disruption of a co-aggregate like RNA.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd><kwd>nucleolus</kwd><kwd>nucleus</kwd><kwd>oocyte</kwd><kwd>ATP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Medical Scientist Training Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hayes</surname><given-names>Michael H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pre-doctoral Fellowship 2015-2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peuchen</surname><given-names>Elizabeth H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM096767</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dovichi</surname><given-names>Norman J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD084399</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dovichi</surname><given-names>Norman J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008893</institution-id><institution>University of Iowa</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Internal Funding Initiative</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weeks</surname><given-names>Daniel L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The equilibrium between solubility and aggregation of proteins in the nucleus is controlled by co-aggregates like RNA and the action of ATP as both an energy source and a destabilizing chemical agent.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Maintenance of protein solubility is crucial for proteostasis. Dysfunction can lead to the aggregation of functional soluble proteins into pathologic self-templating complexes called amyloid. Amyloid aggregates underlie the cytotoxicity seen in Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, type II diabetes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and many other pathologic conditions (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Knowles et al., 2014</xref>). However, the coalescence of proteins into macromolecular complexes, which undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Banani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Courchaine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2013</xref>) or self-assemble into amyloid fibrils, is vital to a diverse set of cellular processes. These aggregated proteins contribute to activities such as hormone storage, formation of non-membrane bound organelles, and long-term memory (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Courchaine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Boke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Heinrich and Lindquist, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Maji et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Majumdar et al., 2012</xref>). Many proteins naturally aggregate. For example, some proteins with RNA binding or low complexity domains exist in both soluble and aggregated states. Switching from one state to the another can be controlled by concentration, environment, or presence of a co-aggregate. In other instances, the switch is an energy dependent process (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Phair and Misteli, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Shorter and Lindquist, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has been shown to influence the balance between soluble and aggregated states for proteins in yeast and metazoans, suggesting normal proteostasis is maintained by energy dependent chaperones and disaggregases (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Brangwynne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Feric et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Kroschwald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Saad et al., 2017</xref>). These enzymes, such as yeast Hsp104 or the Hsp70 co-chaperone complex in metazoans, rely on ATP hydrolysis to maintain the dynamic nature of functionally aggregated proteins and reverse pathological aggregation (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Kroschwald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Saad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Nillegoda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Shorter, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Vacher et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>ATP, best known as the energy currency of the cell, has recently been shown to act as a hydrotrope to destabilize aggregated proteins (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2017</xref>). Hydrotropes are co-solvents capable of bringing poorly soluble or insoluble compounds into solution (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Eastoe et al., 2011</xref>). Hydrotropic solubilization is concentration dependent requiring that the minimum hydrotropic concentration of the hydrotrope be reached before they act as a co-solvent (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Eastoe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Schreier et al., 2000</xref>). Above the minimum hydrotropic concentration, hydrotropes promote solubilization by decreasing the interfacial tension between solute and solvent. Some hydrotropes seem to assume micellular structures while others facilitate solubilization through the formation of more open, planar structures (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Schreier et al., 2000</xref>). Meyer and Voigt, (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Meyer and Voigt, 2017</xref>) in discussing the possible role of ATP as a hydrotrope, point out that ATP would not be expected to form micelles but does have the chemical features needed to serve as a hydrotrope. ATP is able to function as a hydrotrope because it is an amphiphile, a compound with hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. For ATP, the adenosine ring contributes a hydrophobic moiety while the 5' triphosphate contributes the hydrophilic component.</p><p>Using recombinant protein in vitro, Patel and colleagues demonstrated that the hydrotropic activity of ATP was sufficient to solubilize LLPS droplets made from purified protein at concentrations approaching ATP's maximum physiologic level (4&#x02013;8 mM). In contrast, lower yet still physiologic, concentrations of ATP (1&#x02013;2 mM) had a limited effect on protein solubility. Patel et al. (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2017</xref>) postulated that high intracellular concentration of ATP contributes to maintenance of protein solubility and inhibits pathologic protein aggregation in an energy independent manner (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2017</xref>). How interactions with other proteins, post translational modification, or the presence of co-aggregates, like RNA or poly-ADP ribose, may influence an endogenous aggregate&#x02019;s susceptibility to hydrotropic action was not investigated (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Saad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Boamah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Ellis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Tollervey and Kiss, 1997</xref>). Among the cellular structures that feature aggregated proteins are non-membrane bound organelles. For example, nucleoli are formed by the coalescence of proteins into functional aggregates, some of which demonstrate liquid-like behavior, yet contain an amyloid-like component (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Brangwynne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Feric et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hayes and Weeks, 2016</xref>). These features make nucleoli an ideal tissue to test the ability of ATP to act as hydrotrope on aggregates of proteins in vivo.</p><p>Nucleoli are centers for rRNA synthesis, processing, modification, and ribosome-subunit assembly. They have 100s of proteins, and multiple classes of RNA, including rRNA precursors, mature rRNA species and many small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). RNA metabolism plays a central role in nucleolar formation, maintenance, and retention of nucleolar components (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hayes and Weeks, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Franke et al., 1981</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Verheggen et al., 2000</xref>). De novo nucleolar formation is dependent upon the coalescence of RNA binding proteins, such as fibrillarin (Fbl), nucleolin, and nucleophosmin (Npm1), around pre-made 40S rRNAs (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Verheggen et al., 2000</xref>). For at least two of these proteins, Fbl and Npm1, rRNA helps to mediate protein aggregation and LLPS in vitro (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Feric et al., 2016</xref>). The nucleolus is composed of three subregions, whose separation and immiscibility is believed to be the result of differing surface tension values between subregions (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Feric et al., 2016</xref>). The subregions are the granular component, which is the site of ribosome assembly, the dense fibrillar component where rRNA processing and modification occurs, and the fibrillar core, which is the site of rRNA transcription. Each subregion is readily identified by specific markers. Npm1 is found within the granular component, while Fbl marks the dense fibrillar component, and the fibrillar core can be identified by the presence of rDNA repeats or RNA polymerase I (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Feric et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The contents of the vertebrate nucleus, including proteome and pool size of various compounds including ATP, has been reported (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">W&#x000fc;hr et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gall et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kiseleva et al., 2004</xref>). Most cells have one or a few nucleoli. <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte nuclei contain hundreds of functional nucleoli, some of which are larger than entire eukaryotic cells (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gall et al., 2004</xref>). Their large size is amenable to visual assays, and there is specific information regarding proteins that participate or interact with aggregated nucleolar proteins (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Brangwynne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Feric et al., 2016</xref>). Using <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte nuclei, we developed a novel system to investigate the capacity of ATP to act as a hydrotrope on endogenous aggregates. We assembled a roster of proteins that form or are tightly associated with aggregates in the nucleus and nucleolus. Next, we identified conditions where the nuclear environment can be manipulated to vary ATP concentration and alter the relationship between soluble and aggregated proteins. This allowed us to ask specific questions using naturally occurring aggregates in their endogenous, or near endogenous, environment. Under some conditions ATP and a non-hydrolysable analog, 5&#x02032;-(&#x003b2;,&#x003b3;-imido)triphosphate (AMP-PNP) behave similarly, supporting an energy independent role for ATP in solubilization of aggregated nucleolar proteins. However, this process requires a sensitization step, such as aggregate destabilization by RNA depletion or an energy dependent process that requires one or more soluble factors. These results support a two-step model of in vivo solubilization of poteins that coalesce to make aggregates. We propose that ATP initially acts as an energy source for a destabilizing step conferring susceptibility to solubilization, and is supported by the energy independent action of ATP as a biological hydrotrope.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Aggregated proteins are selectively retained in isolated nuclei</title><p>We previously demonstrated that freshly isolated <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte nuclei contain ordered protein aggregates within many sub-nuclear organelles (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hayes and Weeks, 2016</xref>).

Robust dTomato fluorescence and thioflavin T staining was observed immediately post isolation. However, consistent with reports by others, dTomato fluorescence rapidly decreased and was at our limit of visual detection by 30 minutes (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">W&#x000fc;hr et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Paine et al., 1992</xref>). In contrast, thioflavin T staining remains throughout this time course, indicating that aggregated proteins are retained even as soluble nuclear components diffuse away. The fate of small molecules, like ATP (MW&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;507.18), was tested by injecting a fluorescent surrogate, Lucifer Yellow (MW&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;521.57), into nuclei of stage VI oocytes. Nuclei were rapidly isolated in OR2 and imaged at 1 min intervals. The majority of Lucifer Yellow was lost by 5 min post isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), indicating small molecules rapidly equilibrate between isolated nuclei and their surrounding buffer. From an experimental design point of view, this allows for manipulation of the concentration of small molecules, like ATP, through supplementation of the isolation buffer. The concentration of small molecules in the nucleus will match the concentration in aqueous isolation buffer.</p><p>The endogenous protein content of isolated nuclei was analyzed via SDS-PAGE. Nuclei were collected and analyzed at 15 min intervals post isolation. Protein loss was easily apparent at 15 min, and near completion 45 min post isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D&#x02013;E</xref>). The retained protein pool is distinct from the initial protein pool (arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and revealed enrichment of actin when compared to total protein (arrowhead, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E&#x02013;F</xref>). Consistent with previous reports, densitometric analysis revealed that approximately 10% of the initial nuclear protein pool was retained after 1 hr of soluble protein depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E&#x02013;F</xref>) (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Paine et al., 1992</xref>). This analysis demonstrates that most endogenous proteins are lost on the same timescale as soluble dTomato, indicating they too are soluble, and that incubation of nuclei for 1 hr provides a simple method to enrich for endogenously aggregated nuclear proteins.</p><p>To identify components of the retained protein pool, we isolated stage V-VI <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte nuclei in bulk, depleted them of soluble proteins and analyzed them by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Peuchen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Scalenghe et al., 1978</xref>).

Oocytes injected with mRNA encoding GFP-Npm1 and RFP-Fbl were used as a source of nuclei. Nuclei were isolated in OR2, depleted of small molecules and soluble proteins for 1 hr, then transferred into in situ buffer (ISB, which compared with OR2 provides better osmotic support, buffering to stabilize pH when adding nucleotides and potassium rather than sodium to better align with cellular ion concentrations) supplemented with 8 mM ATP or AMP-PNP for 15 min prior to imaging. Fluorescently labeled proteins were retained following this treatment (bottom row, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>Following the same treatment, no changes in thioflavin T staining, used to detect aggregates with amyloid content, were noted (Fig 5B). These findings demonstrate that, although effective on purified protein aggregates in vitro, restoring physiologic levels of ATP alone was not sufficient to solubilize naturally aggregated proteins. Nucleolar proteins are known to cycle between the nucleoplasm and nucleolus (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Huang, 2001</xref>) so we considered whether soluble protein depletion resulted in irreversible aggregate modification, conferring resistance to solubilization. Specifically, we sought to determine if both Npm1 and Fbl were still capable of exchanging between soluble and aggregated pools, represented by maintenance of the ability to transfer from one nucleolus to another. This assay takes advantage of the ability to fuse oocyte nuclei, isolated using&#x000a0;conditions&#x000a0;that deplete or retain soluble nuclear proteins, with one another.

These nuclei should have a full complement of soluble protein and native levels of ATP and other small molecules. When two oil isolated nuclei were fused together, proteins exchange between nucleoli as soon as the samples were placed on the microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), demonstrating how dynamic both Npm1 and Fbl leaving and rejoining their respective nucleolar aggregates can be. Subsequently, soluble protein depleted nuclei, from dually labeled oocytes, were transferred into light mineral oil and merged with unlabeled nuclei isolated under oil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A&#x02013;B</xref>). Within 15 min it was evident that aggregated Npm1 and Fib present in soluble protein depleted nucleoli could be found in their oil isolated counterparts. This observation indicates that soluble protein depletion does not result in irreversible aggregation as they still could serve as exchange donors. Next, we asked if soluble protein depleted nucleoli were still capable of receiving additional protein. To this end, we merged unlabeled soluble protein depleted nuclei with dually labeled oil isolated nuclei. Depleted nucleoli readily accumulated labeled proteins. This observation indicates that soluble protein depletion does not irreversibly alter the ability of nucleoli to accumulate additional proteins in their aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>In the first two rows of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> the fusion of soluble protein depleted nuclei with oil isolated nuclei tested transfer in the presence of approximately half the normal concentration of both soluble protein and ATP. The last row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> tests whether fusion of two soluble protein depleted nuclei would behave the same way. We mixed labeled and unlabeled soluble protein depleted nuclei. Surprisingly, we could detect a faint exchange of GFP-NPM1 between soluble protein depleted nuclei. RFP-Fbl also exchanged between soluble protein depleted nucleoli, but transfer was even lower than that seen for GFP-Npm1 (bottom, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, the large reduction of soluble nuclear proteins and small molecules, including ATP, compromised but did not eliminate protein exchange between nucleolar aggregates. The results show qualitatively that exchange is occurring. A quantitative approach would need to control or know the concentration of both the fluorescent reporter proteins and their endogenous pools, the distance from particle to particle(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>)and differences in the viscosity of the shared environment of the nuclei after fusion.</p><p>We noticed in the experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> that if nucleoli were undergoing fusion at the time of aqueous isolation and soluble protein depletion that they fail to resolve into their normal spherical shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Ex vivo, others have reported a similar stiffened nucleolar phenotype upon ATP depletion (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Brangwynne et al., 2011</xref>). Readdition of physiologic levels of ATP failed to rescue this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, fusion of a soluble protein depleted nuclei into an intact oil isolated nucleus rescued the ability of nucleoli to undergo fusion and return to a spherical shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

In this assay, ATP can participate as both an energy source and hydrotrope to promote solubilization of aggregated proteins. In contrast, AMP-PNP supplementation will likely have an inhibitory effect on energy dependent reactions that use ATP while maintaining the potential for hydrotropic solubilization.

Biological aggregates are in equilibrium with pools of non-aggregated protein, but are conditionally solubilized in response to environment, cell cycle, and other influences. Thus, the solubilization of protein aggregates is an essential process. Aggregate deconstruction has classically been attributed to energy dependent enzymatic reactions involving chaperones, such as Hsp70, and disaggregases like Hsp104. In in vitro studies using purified proteins, Patel and colleagues (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2017</xref>) reported that ATP can function as a hydrotrope to prevent or reverse protein aggregation. However, the ability of ATP to act as a hydrotrope in the context of endogenous protein aggregates was not investigated. Using isolated <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte nuclei, we dissected the ability of ATP to act as a hydrotrope to non-specifically solubilize endogenous protein aggregates or as an energy source to power enzymatic disaggregation.</p><p>The rapid loss of soluble proteins from nuclei isolated in aqueous buffer has been problematic for experiments requiring an intact nucleoplasm or full complement of nuclear factors (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">W&#x000fc;hr et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Carroll and Lehman, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Gardner et al., 2012</xref>). We took advantage of this phenomenon to identify proteins which are stably associated with endogenous nuclear aggregates. Mass spectrometric analysis of retained complexes revealed&#x000a0;~120 proteins, accounting for&#x000a0;~10% of the total nuclear protein mass. Within this selective proteome are proteins that are part of non-membrane bound nuclear structures, RNA binding proteins, and proteins that are capable of forming aggregates (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kato et al., 2012</xref>). While our study focuses on the dynamics of aggregated nucleolar proteins, the aggregate enriched nuclear proteome generated provides a starting point for an expanded analysis of other nuclear structures.</p><p>The nucleolus is a non-membrane bound sub-nuclear organelle with verified protein aggregates. The nucleolus has well characterized domains and signature proteins within each domain have been shown to form LLPS aggregates (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Feric et al., 2016</xref>). Of these, the best characterized are Nucleophosmin (Npm1) and Fibrillarin (Fbl), both of which were identified within our proteomic analysis.</p><p>We used fluorescently labeled variants GFP-Npm1 and RFP-Fbl (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Feric et al., 2016</xref>), to investigate the role ATP plays during endogenous aggregate solubilization. We took advantage of being able to isolate nuclei in three distinct states. (1) Isolation of nuclei in OR2 buffer followed by one hour incubation in OR2 creates nuclei that have lost 90% of total nuclear proteins but retain aggregated proteins. We refer to these nuclei as soluble protein depleted. These nuclei will rapidly equilibrate small molecules, like ATP, to match the small molecule concentration of the assay buffer. (2) Isolation in OR2, and immediate placement in ISB supplemented with the desired concentration of nucleotide and immediately assayed. These nuclei will have at least a partial complement of soluble nuclear proteins in addition to aggregated complexes as long as they are assayed quickly (typically within 15 min of isolation). The more rapid exchange of small molecules like ATP allow manipulation of their concentration by addition to ISB. We refer to these as in situ nuclei. (3) Nuclei can be isolated under oil. Oil isolated nuclei retain endogenous levels of soluble proteins, aggregated proteins and small molecules. We refer to these nuclei as oil isolated or ex vivo.</p><p>Npm1 and Fbl nucleolar aggregates assayed in nuclei that were depleted of soluble nuclear proteins remain stable when treated with 8 mM ATP or AMP-PNP. Although 8 mM is slightly higher than the reported in vivo concentration of frog oocyte ATP (6.2&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.7 mM) (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Miller and Horowitz, 1986</xref>), 8 mM ATP, GTP or AMP-PNP was effective when used by Patel et al. (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2017</xref>)&#x000a0;for hydrotropic solubilization of purified protein aggregates in vitro. The failure to respond to hydrotropic conditions lead to testing for conditions that would lead to changes in the Npm1 and Fbl coalesced in nucleoli.</p><p>The nucleolar Npm1 and Fbl had not been rendered permanently aggregated. Fusion of soluble protein depleted nuclei with oil isolated nuclei showed that nucleoli from soluble protein depleted nuclei can act as both donor and acceptor of aggregation prone proteins such as Npm1 and Fbl. The exchange of proteins between nuceloli has been noted by others and is a reminder that participation in an aggregate is not necessarily a static state (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Phair and Misteli, 2000</xref>).&#x000a0;The fusion of two soluble protein depleted nuclei had low but decernible exchange of Npm1 and Fbl. Exchange activity was enhanced in the presence of soluble nuclear proteins and approximately half normal nuclear levels of ATP provided when oil isolated nuclei were fused with soluble protein depleted nuclei. We note that in these assays Npm1 seemed to be more active in exchange than Fbl. This is consistent with previous work emphasizing that aggregated protein complexes may exhibit different properties (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Feric et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Banini and colleagues (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Banani et al., 2016</xref>), proposed a model where client proteins aggregate around a more stable scaffold. In this context, Npm1 likely falls into the client category. The relative resistance of RFP-Fbl to solubilization suggests that it may contribute to nucleolar structure as a scaffold. Fbl is an RNA binding protein that demonstrates viscoelastic properties following phase separation in vitro, indicating Fbl may assume LLPS droplet and polymer structure. (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Feric et al., 2016</xref>) Consistent with our previous work, this observation suggests that at least a subset of phase-separated Fbl may exist within an amyloid fiber conformation that could contribute to maintenance of a nucleolar scaffold.</p><p>The nuclear fusion experiment indicated that even half the levels of soluble nuclear proteins and small molecules allowed enhanced ability of proteins to join and leave their aggregated state. Using in situ conditions, by immediately assaying after isolation, we were able to show that 8 mM ATP or GTP, but not AMP-PNP leads to disruption of aggregates. We note that although GTP works in this assay, the cellular concentration of GTP is estimated to be between one quarter to one tenth that of ATP. It is also important to note that many enzymes, for example Hsp70 (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abravaya et al., 1992</xref>), are able to use GTP as a substitute for ATP, although, based on cellular concentration, the normal substrate for these enzymes would be ATP. Immediately treating isolated nuclei with 8 mM ATP revealed distinct domain specific responses. Aggregated Npm1 is largely dispersed, however, a thin veil of ATP resistant Npm1 was often observed surrounding RFP-Fbl foci.This observation is consistent with a strong interaction of coalesced Npm1 at the granular component: dense fibrillar component interface. Feric et al. examined the physical properties of purified Fbl and Npm1 in an aqueous environment (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Feric et al., 2016</xref>) and found that the interfacial tension between phases drives Npm1 to engulf Fbl. A phenomenon we also note here.</p><p>Although the fluorescence intensity from aggregated RFP-Fbl foci was decreased, we noted expansion of RFP-Fbl aggregates that settled to the bottom of the depression slide used for imaging. The decrease in fluorescent signal was consistent with RFP-Fbl leaving the aggregated state, while the spreading of the remaining signal was reminiscent of the liquid droplet properties described by others (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Brangwynne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Feric et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>When Npm1 and Fbl aggregates were assayed using in situ conditions 2&#x02013;8 mM ATP supplementation effectively changes aggregate appearrance. A similar assay using 1 mM ATP showed little effect, however, a mix of 1 mM ATP with 3 mM AMP-PNP mimics the effect on Npm1 aggregates seen with 4 mM ATP. We interpret this as evidence that the process depends upon both a hydrolyzable form of ATP needed by soluble nuclear proteins and a hydrotropic effect that can be provided by the non-hydrolyzable analog AMP-PNP.</p><p>RNA has previously been shown to induce aggregate formation or contribute to aggregate maintenance (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Banani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Boke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Feric et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hayes and Weeks, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Schwartz et al., 2013</xref>). We investigated the contribution of RNA to maintenance of aggregate stability of Npm1 and Fbl in nucleoli by treating isolated nuclei with RNase A. We found that RNA depletion sensitized nucleoli to solubilization by ATP and the non-hydrolysable analog AMP-PNP thus removing the requirement for ATP hydrolysis. We suggest that RNase A treatment may mimic or substitute for the destabilization step provided by ATP hydrolysis. These findings implicate ATP dependent remodeling enzymes, such as chaperones, disaggregases, and RNA helicases, as possible mediators of aggregated protein turnover. Furthermore, our results suggest that differences between our observations and those made Patel et al. in vitro may be in part due to differences in the RNA content of the examined LLPS aggregates (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We propose a 2-step model for the in vivo solubilization of nucleolar aggregates that takes into account our experimental observations and suggest that this model may be relevant for many functional aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35224.014</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Two-Step Model of Nucleolar Aggregation and Disaggregation.</title><p>Monomeric proteins self-associate driving phase separation.

We suggest a second step, aggregate solubilization, can be mediated by the energy independent hydrotropic activity of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>), but requires a relatively high (2 mM or more) concentration. Assembly of nuclear aggregates could be a simple reversal of this model, where a stabilizing interaction, such as RNA binding or protein modification exceeds the capacity of ATP to maintain protein solubility in the absence of hydrolysis. Stabilization promotes the coalescence of proteins and other components inducing liquid-like phase separation. Once phase separated, particles can mature into a more stable form through limited formation of amyloid fibers, whose maintenance is dependent on continuous interaction with a stabilizing factor.</p><p>Invoking the ability of ATP to behave as a hydrotrope raises the interesting possibility that the equilibrium between the aggregated and free pool of aggregate forming proteins is affected by protein sequence, co-aggregates, or post-translational modification; but also by cellular compartment and local concentration of ATP. There are differences in published values, both for intracellular ATP levels and total ATP levels (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Miller and Horowitz, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Traut, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Harper et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Miyoshi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Wright et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Ytting et al., 2012</xref>). In the conditions tested here the concentration of ATP in the nucleus may favor solubilization unless a stabilizer is present or proteins are altered to promote aggregation. Alternatively, the 4 or 5-fold lower concentration reported in the cytosol may require proteins, once aggregated, to undergo active regulation to take them apart.</p><p>The ability to measure and observe temporospatial variability of ATP concentrations is becoming more feasible. New tools have been developed to document changes in ATP concentration in response to metabolic conditions within single cells, and regional changes to intracellular ATP concentrations in response to cellular morphology (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Ytting et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Yaginuma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki et al., 2015</xref>). These changes ranged from a 10% decrease to an over three-fold increase in local concentration and can be transient or long lived. Another factor that may influence the local concentration of ATP is the aggregation of proteins themselves. Patel et al. (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2017</xref>) note that FUS aggregates formed in a solution containing fluorescently labeled ATP were enriched&#x000a0;in ATP by fourfold over the solution concentration. Thus, local cellular environment, age, metabolic changes in ATP turnover, or free intracellular ATP likely play an underappreciated role in the biology of protein aggregation.</p><p>Our observations add to the deliberation on the contribution ATP makes to the maintenance of protein solubility, functional protein aggregation and the regulation of non-membrane bound organelles. By showing that the hydrotropic properties of ATP can affect naturally occurring aggregates, we highlight the need to view endogenous levels of ATP within cellular compartments as more than a source of energy.</p><p>Our work also emphasizes the need to control for, or acknowledge, the influence of local concentrations when designing or interpreting experiments. This is readily apparent when looking at functional protein aggregation, where the average cellular contents or concentration of a molecule does not accurately reflect cellular conditions or the local protein environment.

Oocytes were lysed in a 60 mL syringe containing L-15 media supplemented with 0.2% NP-40 (three parts lysis medium to one part oocytes). With gentle agitation, intact nuclei float to the top of the syringe and&#x000a0;are transferred into a 5 mL syringe using a three-way valve. Nuclei were purified form contaminating yolk and cytosolic content by sedimentation through L-15 containing 0.1M sucrose on ice. Nuclei were collected and transferred to 60 mM dishes containing 5 mL of OR2, where their envelopes were manually removed and soluble proteins were depleted. Samples were then processed for proteomic analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Proteomic analysis</title><p>Details&#x000a0;on proteomic experiments are provided below and were based on protocols used in the Dovichi lab (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Peuchen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Wi&#x0015b;niewski et al., 2009</xref>).

The data set obtained using the protocol indicated and designated &#x02018;Purple&#x02019; included proteins we verified as retained and aggregated using both microscopy and western blot analysis. Other preparations identified fewer proteins and failed to identify known aggregates.</p><p>Rapid isolation and collection of manually dissected Xenopus oocyte nuclei has been used to describe the nuclear proteome of a vertebrate. Like those studies, we found that soluble proteins are easily depleted from manually isolated nuclei by simple extending the time between dissection and collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Our initial attempts to characterize the aggregated nuclear proteome used the limited amount of material we were able to manually harvest in a reasonable amount of time. We next investigated the use of two different bulk nuclear isolation protocols. Date sets from these trials and the dataset used for the analysis in this manuscript are all deposited at MassIVE.</p><p>Our initial attempts at bulk nuclear isolation were modeled off the protocol described by <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Lehman and Carroll (1993)</xref>. Retained proteins from nuclei isolated in this manner did not replicate the pattern seen following soluble protein depletion of manually isolated nuclei. Therefore, we attempted further enrich for aggregate associated proteins by washing &#x02018;Carroll&#x02019; isolated nuclei with OR2. In parallel experiments, we wanted to identify RNA dependent aggregate associated proteins. To do so, we washed bulk isolated nuclei with 10 mg/mL RNase A supplemented OR2 for 1 hr. These additional manipulations also failed to replicate the results of manually isolated and soluble protein depleted nuclei.</p><p>We next performed bulk nuclear isolation based on the protocol described by Scalenghe et al. (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Scalenghe et al., 1978</xref>) SDS PAGE analysis of these samples (designated &#x02018;purple&#x02019; in the deposited) more closely resembled the results of our manually isolated and soluble protein depleted nuclei. Therefore, we proceeded with this protocol, with two modifications. Following isolation, we incubated nuclei in OR2 for 1 hr, to more closely replicate our manual isolation protocol, and we manually removed nuclear envelopes to limit our analysis to intra nuclear aggregates. Nuclear envelopes were collected and included as a separate sample in our proteomic analysis.</p><p>In the deposited data&#x000a0;sets samples designated IGS represent proteins recovered from fresh nuclei, nuclei depleted of soluble proteins are in data sets: Wash N3-10-1,Wash N3-10-2,Wash N63-10,OR2 and Purple Wash.

Samples designations were &#x02018;Fresh&#x02019; for whole nuclei, Pellet for retained proteins (including envelope proteins) and SN for proteins that left the nucleus during equilibration in OR2. In addition, a single biological replicate, analyzed in triplicate, of nuclei treated with RNaseA and of isolated nuclear envelope protein is included as part of the sample coded &#x02018;Purple&#x02019;.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article "Dual roles for ATP in the regulation of phase separated protein aggregates in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte nucleoli" for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Wells et al. build upon a recent finding from that ATP can function as a hydrotrope to increase protein solubility and investigate this function of ATP in nuclei isolated from <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. The authors identified that nucleolar proteins selectively aggregate in nuclei extracted in aqueous buffers. The authors employ fluorescently tagged nucleolar proteins Npm1 (as a marker for granular component) and Fbl (as a marker for the fibrillar component of the nucleolus) and use fluorescence microscopy to measure the extent of protein aggregation in various extraction conditions. Notably, the authors find that ATP and a non-hydrolysable ATP analog, ANP-PNP have differential activities in solubilizing the nucleolar components.</p><p>The key claim in the paper is that the increased solubility of the nuclear aggregates in the presence of ATP arises from a combination of ATP acting as an energy source and as a hydrotrope. ATP consuming chaperones such as Hsp70 have been known to increase protein solubility both in vitro and in cells. This is interesting, as it suggests how the dual roles of ATP as a hydrotrope and as an energy source might function to keep proteins soluble.</p><p>While we are potentially interested in publishing the manuscript, we would like you to address the following controls and clarifications. In particular the paper would benefit from more focus on the problem to be solved and how it is being addressed. This paper makes an important point about the dual roles of ATP. As currently written, it contains a number of statements that are distracting from the message.</p><p>Essential revisions including issues that can be addressed by modifying the text:</p><p>1) The authors should investigate whether the observed effects arise due to salts that accompany ATP/ATP analogs by preparing solutions at identical salt compositions. For hydrotrope effect, the authors may use a mixture of adenosine base and phosphate salts as additional controls. Similarly, authors should directly show that ATP hydrolysis is essential for the proposed 'sensitization'.</p><p>2) The rationale for choosing different buffer conditions should be better articulated in the manuscript. The authors should show that the ISB/TB buffer does not lead to protein depletion.</p><p>3) The work would also benefit from careful quantitative analysis of microscopy data. The extent of exchange in Figure 3 or relocalization of proteins in Figures 4-7 should be quantified. Similarly, the time-scales of experiments with 'rapid isolation' could be better defined.</p><p>In particular:</p><p>a) please quantify Figure 4 as a dose response curve of Fibrillarin and Nucleoplasmin intensities in response to ATP and AMP-PNP concentrations.</p><p>b) Have a figure and dose response curve comparing the Fibrillarin and Nucleoplasmin intensities in response to ATP in the presence and absence of the diffusible factor.</p><p>4) The authors propose that there might be two species of NPM1 in the GC. However, this proposal does not come with any evidence. Pending any investigations of the conformational states of NPM1 to demonstrate that there indeed are two distinct species of NPM1, there might actually be a simpler explanation that derives from the work of Feric et al. They showed that NPM1 rounds up on hydrophobic surfaces and spreads on hydrophilic surfaces (see Brangwynne, Mitchison and Hyman, 2011). Therefore, a simpler way to think of the problem is in terms of interfacial tensions. If the interfacial tension between the GC and the solvent is lower than the interfacial tension between the GC and the DFC, both of which involve NPM1, then the thinning that is observed in the presence of non-hydrolyzable ATP would make sense. The observations would be entirely consistent with a capillary phenomenon rather than a two-species model. The authors would do well to include this as another plausible explanation for their observations regarding the impact of non-hydrolyzable ATP on the GC.</p><p>5) The discussion of LLPS in paper is misleading and somewhat unwarranted. The results that the authors describe do not necessarily pertain to liquid-liquid demixing. The authors should consider rewording the Introduction and Discussion sections.</p><p>6) The Introduction could use work. There are quite a few confusing statements, some which might end up being distracting and/or misleading. Considerable space is devoted to the topic of hydrotropes forming micelle-like structures. This may well be true for ATP and smaller hydrotropes, but Eastoe, Hatzopoulos, and Dowding (2011) is not the one to cite as it is focused on reviewing data for a very different class of hydrotropes. If the issue of ATP micellization needs to be raised &#x02013; and it is not clear why this matters here &#x02013; then this should come up in the Discussion, perhaps in a coherent discussion of linkage phenomena. And in doing so, please explain how/why micelle formation will lead to solubilization. Also, in general, the Introduction needs paring down and it should focus on describing the problem being solved (what), why it is important, and a short summary of main findings. As written, there are far too many distracting and confounding pronouncements.</p><p>7) The authors raise an interesting point in the Discussion and this pertains to the maintenance of concentration gradients and/or depots of ATP. The active liquid question and the existence of fields or loci of energy availability and its implications for organization of matter is of fundamental importance. Indeed, there have been elegant calcium/ATP labeling experiments in cells and these would be worth citing in the Discussion.

In the comparison of ATP and AMP-PNP we are using the same salt conditions during direct comparison, and we have endeavored to make that clearer. Although the test with adenosine and phosphate salt could be done, we note that, AMP and ADP were directly tested by Patel et al., who concluded that although these compounds could mediate the hydrotropic effects of ATP, they require higher concentrations. Coupled with the disparity between normal cellular concentrations of AMP, ADP (or any other nucleotide triphosphate like GTP) and that of ATP we would suggest that control is no more meaningful that the comparison of ATP and AMP-PNP.</p><p>We include a direct look at GTP compared to ATP in an assay for retentions or loss of nuclear aggregates under the two conditions used for isolation of nuclei in aqueous buffer in the new Figure 5. We show that under conditions that retain soluble nuclear proteins that the thioflavin T detection of nucleolar aggregates is reduced. We discuss what that means with respect to potential action as an energy source and as a hydrotrope.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, authors should directly show that ATP hydrolysis is essential for the proposed 'sensitization'.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concern raised that we have not directly shown ATP hydrolysis but, the assays we employ would not be able to distinguish whether the hydrolysis is a direct, indirect or coincidental to the results. We can (and now do) replace the assertion that ATP is being hydrolysed with the more cautious indicator that AMP-PMP does not substitute for hydrolysable ATP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The rationale for choosing different buffer conditions should be better articulated in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have introduced the rationale in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should show that the ISB/TB buffer does not lead to protein depletion.</p></disp-quote><p>First of all, we apologize for our error in not being consistent with our nomenclature. TB and ISB are the same buffer. We now uniformly use ISB. ISB does not result in the retention of nuclear proteins. We have altered the text to make this point clearer. The timing of treatment, immediate vs. 1h post isolation, that determines the protein/small molecule content of the sample. ISB buffer was used to more closely resemble the nuclear environment (e.g. KCl instead of NaCl) and facilitate enzymatic reactions. We note that the observations made in Figures 2C and 4A have made assaying in both OR2 and ISB, but for consistency in this work we present images captured from nuclei in ISB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The work would also benefit from careful quantitative analysis of microscopy data.

Quantification of the kinetics of exchange, especially in comparison to previously data, would prove interesting. Trans-nuclear protein exchange is a diffusion limited phenomenon, which prevents us from making quantitative measurements in our system. For quantitative measurements to be possible, at least two criteria would need to be met: 1) Homogenous mixing of trans nuclei to control for the distance of diffusion, something we were unable to accomplish. 2) A constant concentration of labeled and unlabeled protein across mixing reactions. The amount of labeled protein within nuclei is dependent upon multiple factors. Some, such as mass of injected synthetic mRNA, we are able to control. Others, such as the volume of isolated nuclei, we are unable to control. We regret that these variables prevent us from accurately measuring protein exchange but feel that the qualitative observation can be interpreted and has value.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors propose that there might be two species of NPM1 in the GC.

They pointed toward work carried out by Ferric et al. that made several observations on the interaction of NPM1 with hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. Their point is valid and we have included the alternative explanation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The discussion of LLPS in paper is misleading and somewhat unwarranted. The results that the authors describe do not necessarily pertain to liquid-liquid demixing. The authors should consider rewording the Introduction and Discussion sections.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sensitive to providing clarity with regard to what we are testing. We view LLPS as one form among many of protein aggregation. Both fibrillarin and nucleoplasmin (FBL and Npm1) have been featured in studies on LLPS so we feel it is necessary to point that out. We have added a reference (Berry et al.. 2018) that should be useful for readers interested in LLPS, including mixing and demixing. The data we present in the original Figure 7 (now Figure 8), as noted by the reviewer are not a direct test of mixing-demixing, but do suggest that a co-aggregate, in this case RNA, plays a role along with the proteins themselves and ATP in providing a suitable environment to maintain phase borders. As noted below, we have reworded both the Introduction and the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The Introduction could use work.

Although it is clear some hydrotropes do form micellular structure, it is not a universal feature. We have trimmed that section down to point readers to two other references that point out what self-associating structures have been reported for hydrotropes, including one recent commentary by Meyer and Voigt (2017) that was stimulated by the work of Patel et al. We appreciate the frank pronouncement regarding distracting and confound pronouncements and have made substantive changes to remedy the problem.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors raise an interesting point in the Discussion and this pertains to the maintenance of concentration gradients and/or depots of ATP.
