<p class="p">Hydrodistillation was conducted using an Electromantle™ (EM2000 CE, Electrothermal Engineering Ltd., UK, 500 W). Seventy‐five grams of air‐dried plant material was weighed into a round flask. Then, 750 ml of distilled water (1:10, w/v) was added. Extraction was performed for three hours. Next, the essential oil was collected and placed into a vial with anhydrous sodium sulfate to remove any water. Then, vials were stored at 4°C for later analysis.</p>
