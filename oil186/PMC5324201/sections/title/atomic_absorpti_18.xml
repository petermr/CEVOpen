 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mg, Fe, Mn and Ca were analysed by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (Varian AA 240 FS). Al was analyzed by Zeeman Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (Varian AA 240 Z) in graphite furnace and the total Hg was analyzed by cold vapor hydrate generation Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (Varian AA 220 FS) followed by the Varian operating manual. The metal stock standard for Mg, Fe, Ca, Al and Mn were 1000 mg/L (Reference/Traceable) and quantification limit for the elements were at ppm levels. The detection limit for Fe, Mn and Al are 0.027, 0.005 and 0.00196 mg/mL respectively. On the other hand, Hg stock standard was AR grade of equivalent 100 mg/L. The quantification limit for the total Hg was 0.01 μg/L (ppb). All calibrated standard, quality control standard and check standard are traceable to National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST). Recovery of quality spiked sample, duplicate samples and quality control sample were observed. The recovery ranges for each parameter were 100 ± 10%.</p>
