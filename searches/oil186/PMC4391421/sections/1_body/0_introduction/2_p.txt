0: Various studies have aimed to investigate the chemical composition and biological properties of the T. vulgaris essential oil (EO).
1: According to European Pharmacopoeia 5.0 (Ph.
2: Eur.
3: 5.0) [ 3], the minimum content of EO in T. vulgaris is 12 mL/kg, but the chemical composition shows variations, six chemotypes being mainly reported, namely geraniol, linalool, gamma-terpineol, carvacrol, thymol and trans-thujan-4-ol/terpinen-4-ol [ 4, 5].
4: Both the isolation yield and the chemical composition of the EOs are dependent on a number of factors, such as the environment, growth region and cultivation practices [ 6].
5: In addition to the flavoring properties determined by the constitutive active ingredients, the thyme EO exhibits significant antimicrobial activity [ 4, 7- 9] as well as strong antioxidant properties [ 2, 8].
