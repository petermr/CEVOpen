  <title>Objective:</title>
  <p>The aim of this study is to determine the phytochemical composition, antifungal activity of 
   <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> essential oil (MPE) against 
   <italic>Fusarium sporotrichioides</italic>.
  </p>
 </sec>
 <sec id="st2">
  <title>Methods:</title>
  <p>The phytochemical composition was conducted by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC MS) analysis and mycelia growth inhibition was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC), the morphological characterization was observed by scanning electron microscopy. Finally, the membrane permeability was determined by the release of extracellular constituents, pH, and total lipid content.</p>

  <title>Result:</title>
  <p>In GC MS analysis, 22 metabolites were identified such as menthol, l menthone, pulegone, piperitone, caryophyllene, menthol acetate, etc. The antifungal activity against targeted pathogen, with MIC and MFC 500 μg/mL and 1000 μg/mL, respectively. The MPE altered the morphology of 
   <italic>F. sporotrichoides</italic> hyphae with the loss of cytoplasm content and contorted the mycelia. The increasing concentration of MPE showed increase in membrane permeability of 
   <italic>F. sporotrichoides</italic> as evidenced by the release of extracellular constituents and pH with the disruption of cell membrane indicating decrease in lipid content of 
   <italic>F. sporotrichoides</italic>.

  <title>Conclusion:</title>
  <p>The observed results showed that MPE exhibited promising new antifungal agent against 
   <italic>Fusarium sporotrichioides</italic>.
