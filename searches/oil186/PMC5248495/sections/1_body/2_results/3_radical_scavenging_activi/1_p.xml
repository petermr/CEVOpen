<p>The results of radical DPPH assay for of 
 <italic>O.</italic> x 
 <italic>citriodorum</italic>, 
 <italic>O. basilicum var.purpureum, O. basilicum var. thyrsiflora</italic> essential oils are shown on Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The highest antioxidant activity was demonstrated by 
 <italic>O. basilicum var. thyrsiflora</italic> essential oil: IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for it was equal to the standardized Grapefruit Seed Extract which was used as a control sample (2.5 μL/mL). The antiradical activity for the other two basil species was lower: IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for 
 <italic>O.</italic> x 
 <italic>citriodorum</italic> essential oil was 20 μL/mL and for 
 <italic>O. basilicum var. purpureum</italic> was 22 μL/mL. These results were somewhat unexpected, since usually the oils with higher phenolic content are the ones exhibiting higher radical scavenging abilities, whereas in our case the highest antioxidant properties were displayed by the cultivar with the highest linalool (terpene alcohol) content.
