<p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the main component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and is known as an inductor of inflammation in various cells, including astrocytes [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. LPS is recognized by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) of astrocytes and the LPS treatment of astrocytes resulting in activation of transcription factor (NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) which lead to the release of such inflammatory mediators as pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines or the tumor necrosis factor (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>) or the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Many studies have previously reported LPS induction of various inflammatory mediators in astrocytes [
