<p class="p">A comparative analysis of essential oils from roots of soil-grown plants and hairy roots by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) demonstrated that the chemical profiles of both essential oils were different. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1" class="xref"> Table 1</xref> presents the chemical constituents of essential oils with their relative percentage amounts and retention indices. In the SGR essential oil, 41 compounds were identified, representing 89.7% of the total oil while 44 compounds were detected in the HR essential oils, amounting to 81.9% of the total identified components (
