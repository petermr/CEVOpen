<p class="p">The cumulative yield of the essential oils from rosemary obtained during a single extraction from the three repetitions for each extraction method as a function of time is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. For both extraction techniques, CH or MAH, the extraction temperature is equal to the boiling of the water at atmospheric pressure (100°C). To reach this temperature and to obtain the distillation of the first droplet of essential oil of rosemary, it is necessary to heat for 3 min only with MAH against 45 min for the CH. A 20-minute extraction time by MAH gives a yield similar to that obtained after 180 min by means of CH.
