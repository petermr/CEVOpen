  <span class="sup">•</span>OH) Scavenging Assay

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hydroxyl radical scavenging assay was performed as described by Tellone et al. [
  <a rid="B38-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-ijms-18-01212">38</a>]. This assay is based on quantification of the degradation product of 2-deoxyribose by condensation with thiobarbituric acid (TBA). The reaction mixture contained the following in the final volume of 1.0 mL: 2.8 mM 2-deoxy-2-ribose, 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 25 µM FeCl
  <sub>3</sub>, 100 µM EDTA, 2.8 mM H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub>, 100 µM ascorbic acid and sample solution in order to obtain the final concentration range of 15–0.92 µg/mL. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 ± 0.5 °C in a water bath. Then 1.0 mL of 1% (
  <span class="italic">w</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span>) TBA was added to each mixture followed by the addition of 1 mL of 2.8% (
  <span class="italic">w</span>/
  <span class="italic">v</span>) trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The solutions were heated in a water bath at 100 °C for 15 min to develop the pink coloured malondialdehyde–thiobarbituric acid adduct. After cooling, the absorbance was measured at 532 nm against an appropriate blank solution. The inhibition (%) of radical scavenging activity was calculated using Equation (1).
