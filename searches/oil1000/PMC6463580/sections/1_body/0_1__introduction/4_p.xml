 <italic class="italic">Rosmarinus officinalis L.</italic> essential oil is usually isolated by hydrodistillation, steam distillation, or extraction with organic solvents. These techniques cause the loss of certain volatile compounds due to long extraction times and degradation of unsaturated or esterified compounds by thermal or hydrolytic effect. For example, monoterpenes may be susceptible to chemical changes under stream distillation conditions and even the conventional solvent extraction during removal of solvent by distillation. In addition, many of these methods are time-consuming and energy intensive [
