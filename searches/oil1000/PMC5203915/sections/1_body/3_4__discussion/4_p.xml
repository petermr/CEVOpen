<p class="p">The major compounds of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons in HR essential oil were cyperene (18%), 13-norcypera-1(5),11(12)-diene (15%), and cadalene (7%). The levels of these components were significantly higher than those evaluated in the SGR essential oil. Interestingly, Havlik et al. [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] found similar results for essential oil isolated from
 <italic class="italic"> R. carthamoides</italic> roots and rhizomes of commercial material and also showed that 13-norcypera-1(5),11(12)-diene (22.6%) and cyperene (17.9%) were the major compounds in this essential oil. Cadalene was identified for the first time in
