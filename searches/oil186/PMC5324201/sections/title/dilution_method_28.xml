 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentrations (MBC) assays were carried out on the essential oil by the macro-dilution method [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>]. The essential oil was dissolved in 30% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain 10% (w/v) solution. For MIC test of the selected bacteria, the essential oil was first diluted in sterilized Mueller-Hinton broth in screw capped tubes containing broth medium in the concentration of 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5 and 31.25 μg/mL. Bacterial suspensions of the test organism were prepared in sterilized Mueller-Hinton broth. 1 mL of the dilution was added to each sterilized screw capped tube containing 1 mL of sample suitably diluted in the sterilized broth medium to give a final volume of 2 mL. A culture medium without sample (solvent DMSO) was used as a negative control. Ciprofloxacin (100–0.191 μg/mL.) was used as positive control. Tubes were incubated aerobically at 37 °C for 18 h and the growth was indicated by turbidity. The lowest concentration (preventing visible growth indicated by no turbidity) was identified as the MIC and expressed in μg/mL. The complete absence of growth was considered as the MBC [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>]. To confirm the results of MBC, 10 μL of the experimental suspensions (withdrawn from the tubes with no growth) were subcultured on TSA (Tryptone Soy Agar) plates. The Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. It showed no bacterial growth, which was taken as the MBC. Values were recorded as μg/mL.
