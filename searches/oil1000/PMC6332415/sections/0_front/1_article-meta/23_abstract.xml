 <p class="p">Chemical composition, antioxidant and anti-
  <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> spp. activities of the essential oil isolated from the aerial parts of 
  <italic class="italic">Mentha spicata</italic> L. (spearmint) are investigated in the present study. The effect of the essential oil on 
  <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> spp. biofilm inhibition and eradication was tested using the XTT assay. A total of 63 chemical constituents were identified in spearmint oil using GC/MS, constituting 99.9% of the total identified compounds. The main components were carvone (40.8% ± 1.23%) and limonene (20.8% ± 1.12%). The antimicrobial activity against 30 
  <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> spp. strains (16 species) was evaluated by disc diffusion and microdilution assays. All microorganisms were strongly affected, indicating an appreciable antimicrobial potential of the oil. Moreover, the investigated oil exhibited high antioxidant potency, as assessed by four different tests in comparison with BHT. The ability of the oil, belonging to the carvone chemotype, to inhibit or reduce 
  <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> spp. biofilm warrants further investigation to explore the use of natural products in antibiofilm adhesion and reinforce the possibility of its use in the pharmaceutical or food industry as a natural antibiotic and seafood preservative against 
  <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> contamination.
