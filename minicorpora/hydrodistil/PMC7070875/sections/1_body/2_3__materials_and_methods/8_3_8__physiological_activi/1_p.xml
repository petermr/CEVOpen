<p>Experiments on rats were performed according to the Iraqi and institutional rules considering animal experiments, and in accordance with the internationally accepted principles for laboratory animal use and care as found in the European Community guidelines (EEC Directive of 1986; 86/609/EEC). Stock solutions (0.05% g/L) of tested volatile fractions and 1,8-cineole were prepared by dissolving the desired amount in DMSO in which samples are completely soluble and which helped dissolution in water. They were kept refrigerated until analysis. Desired serial dilutions were then prepared by diluting stock solutions with aqueous NaCl (0.09% g/L) and warmed to 37 °C prior to use.</p>
