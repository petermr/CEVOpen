<p class="p">The garlic essential oil and their toxic constituents compromised the respiration rate of 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> up to 3 h after exposure, likely reflecting in behavior response and subsequently, the locomotors activity. Respiratory rate and body mass of insects can represent the sum of the energy demands of the physiological processes of insects that are necessary to produce defense mechanisms against the essential oils and toxic compounds

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" class="xref">51</xref>. Thus, low respiration rate is an indicator of physiological stress, and essential oils can compromise insect respiration by impairing muscle activity, leading to paralysis

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" class="xref">51</xref>. Several studies of plant volatile and their constituents were shown to effectively disrupt the recognition process of the host substrate and influence the walking behavior on insects

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" class="xref">54</xref>. In this study, adults of 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> have low respiration rate caused by garlic essential oil and their constituents, resulting in physiological costs due to energy reallocation from other basic physiological processes. This favors the use of these toxic compounds by fumigant action and can cause significant negative effects on 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic>.
