<p class="p">Due to its physiological and anatomical resemblance to humans, intestinal roundworm parasites adult earthworms 
 <italic class="italic">Pheretima posthuma</italic> (10 cm long) were used to evaluate the anthelmintic activity of 
 <italic class="italic">T. bovei</italic> essential oil at different concentrations. Anthelmintic assay was carried out by dividing the earth worms into eight groups containing 10 worms in each group, five different concentrations of the essential oil (10, 40, 50, 75, and 100 mg/ml) in distilled water were prepared for the study. Distilled water was used as control. The reference drug piperazine citrate were also prepared in distilled water at 10 mg/ml. The time of paralysis was recorded when no movement was observed even after vigorous shaking. The time of death of worms was recorded after ascertaining that the worms neither moved when shaken vigorously nor when dipped in warm water (50 °C). The anthelmintic activity was determined by the method followed by Dash et al. 2002 [
