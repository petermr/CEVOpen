<p>Qualitative analysis was performed using an Agilent gas chromatograph model 7,890 coupled to a Agilent mass spectrometer model 5975 equipped with a DB5 MS column (20 m × 0.18 mm; 0.18 μm). The oven temperature was 50°C and remained constant for 3.2 min; then, it was increased to 300°C at a rate of 8°C/min. The injector temperature was 280°C. Ionization was obtained by electron impact at 70 eV, and the electron multiplier was maintained at 2200 eV. The temperature of the ion source was 230°C. Mass spectral data were acquired in the scan mode in the range m/z 33–450. The flow of carrier gas (helium) was set at 0.9 ml/min; compound identification was made by comparison of their spectra and RI with those of libraries such as Adams (
