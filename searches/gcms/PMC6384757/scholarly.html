Abstract</div> <p> <i>Artemisia argyi</i> Lévl. et Vant essential oil could be used as a good antimicrobial flavouring agent and applied in the food industry. In this study, three methods, including simultaneous distillation-extraction (SDE), subcritical extraction and hydrodistillation, were applied to extract <i>A. argyi</i> essential oil. Compared with subcritical extraction (1%) and hydrodistillation (0.5%), SDE gave a higher yield (1.2%). Components of the essential oils were analysed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the most abundant ingredients were caryophyllene oxide, neointermedeol, borneol, α-thujone and β-caryophyllene. These five components accounted for 82.93%, 40.90% and 40.33% for SDE, subcritical extraction, and hydrodistillation, respectively. Based on agar disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays, SDE oil showed a significant inhibitory effect towards <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Proteus vulgaris</i>, <i>Salmonella enteritidis</i> and <i>Aspergillus niger</i>. Furthermore, electron microscope observations (SEM) confirmed that SDE oil could obviously deform cell morphology and destroy the structure of cell walls. Performances showed that SDE was a promising process for extracting <i>A. argyi</i> essential oil with both high yield and antimicrobial activity. </p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="kwd" title="kwd"> <i>Artemisia argyi</i> </div> <div class="kwd" title="kwd">

1. Introduction</div> <p> <i>Artemisia argyi</i>, known as Chinese mugwort, is an herbaceous perennial plant with creeping rhizomes. <i>A. argyi</i> is the most popular plant in China and eastern Asia, and its leaves are used as a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TMC). <i>Artemisia</i> species are important medical plants which have aroused interest for their biological and chemical diversities [ <a href="#B1-molecules-24-00483">1</a>]. Known for a long time for the treatment of diseases such as asthma, inflammation, hepatitis and infections by bacteria, fungi or viruses [ <a href="#B2-molecules-24-00483">2</a>], <i>A. capillaris herba</i> has officially been listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and applied in the treatment of epidemic hepatitis [ <a href="#B3-molecules-24-00483">3</a>]. In addition, in Europe, the use of <i>A. mexicana</i> to stimulate the appetite and to aid digestion is allowed [ <a href="#B4-molecules-24-00483">4</a>]. </p> <p>The main pharmacological active compound in <i>A. argyi</i> is the essential oil and the biological activities of the extracted essential oil have been investigated. For example, it has been reported that <i>A. argyi</i> essential oil showed anti-histaminic effects and antifungal activity [ <a href="#B5-molecules-24-00483">5</a>]. Moreover, <i>A. argyi</i> volatile oil had strong antibacterial effects against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Salmonella enteritidis</i> [ <a href="#B6-molecules-24-00483">6</a>]. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has been proved to be an useful method for the determination of the different essential oil components. Recently, the composition of essential oil extracted from leaves and flowers of <i>A. argui</i> has been reported [ <a href="#B7-molecules-24-00483">7</a>], and the major components were sesquiterpenes, monoterpenes, alcohols, ketones, aromatic compounds esters and ethers, etc. Based on the appealing aromatic properties, <i>A. argui</i> essential oil could play a significant role in food safety and preservation [ <a href="#B8-molecules-24-00483">8</a>]. At present, most preservatives used by the food industry are artificial additives such as nitrates, sulphur dioxide and benzoates [ <a href="#B9-molecules-24-00483">9</a>]. Natural compounds may have great commercial value in the food industry, however their applications are currently limited owing to their high cost. Hence, an effective and low-cost preparation method is needed. </p> <p>Classical methods of extraction, such as solid-liquid extraction with organic solvents, are used for the extraction of lipid fractions and essential oils from aromatic plants. These solvents provide good recovery of oil and other compounds, but they have certain drawbacks such as potential human and environmental toxicity. Compared with the classical methods, hydrodistillation has been the most common method used to extract the essential oils from plants. Although this method still has drawbacks such as long extraction times and high energy use, hydrodistillation is the simplest and most practical method [ <a href="#B10-molecules-24-00483">10</a>, <a href="#B11-molecules-24-00483">11</a>]. Recently, there has been great interest in subcritical extraction for its mild operational temperature, no solvent residues and better nutrition retention. Because subcritical solvents have the advantages of high density, high diffusively and low viscosity, the subcritical extraction method has been widely applied in lipid and essential oil extraction [ <a href="#B12-molecules-24-00483">12</a>]. Furthermore, it is reported that simultaneous distillation-extraction (SDE) could be also used in essential oil extraction. This one-step extraction technique is less time consuming and allows a greater reduction of solvent volumes due to the continuous recycling. Under certain conditions a higher yield and richer ingredients could be achieved and the extracts obtained by SDE are free from non-volatile materials such as cuticular waxes and chlorophylls [ <a href="#B13-molecules-24-00483">13</a>, <a href="#B14-molecules-24-00483">14</a>]. Recently, our laboratory has focused on searching for valuable plant essential oils which could be applied in the food safety and preservation. Up to now, <i>A. argyi</i> essential oils extracted by simultaneous distillation have never been reported. In this study, we examined different methods, including SDE, subcritial extraction and hydro-distillation, for <i>A. argyi</i> essential oil extraction and characterized the corresponding compositions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of these methods on the yield and the biological characteristics of the essential oil, and to analyze its inhibitory effects on microorganisms that cause vegetable, fruit and other food losses. </p> </div> <div class="results" title="results"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
2. Results and Discussion</div> <div class="2.1.extractionyieldsofa.argyiessentialoils" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
2.1. Extraction Yields of A. argyi Essential Oils</div> <p> <i>A. argyi</i> essential oils were extracted with hydrodistillation, subcritical extraction and SDE respectively. Their extraction time, yields and colors were evaluated. As shown in <a href="#molecules-24-00483-t001">Table 1</a>, SDE took the shortest time (180 min) and gave the highest yield (1.2%), followed by subcritical extraction (1%) and hydrodistillation (0.5%). The yields of these extracted oils were higher than the reported ones, which were around 0.20% to 0.26% [ <a href="#B15-molecules-24-00483">15</a>]. Furthermore, SDE cost 1 h less than hydrodistillation, and 2 h less than subcritical extraction. Compared with the other studies, SDE is a feasible method which offers yield and processing time advantages. </p> </div> <div class="2.2.compositionsofa.argyiessentialoils" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
2.2. Compositions of A. argyi Essential Oils</div> <p>The identified components of <i>A. argyi</i> essential oils obtained from the three different extraction methods and their concentrations are shown in <a href="#molecules-24-00483-t002">Table 2</a>. </p> <p>The contents of compounds varied markedly along with the extraction method. As shown in <a href="#molecules-24-00483-t002">Table 2</a>, a total of 65, 62 and nine compounds were identified for the essential oil extracted with hydrodistillation, subcritical extraction and SDE, accounting for the 86.318%, 94.496% and 99.997% of total oil, respectively. Different from SDE oil, subcritical extraction oil and hydrodistillation oil were dominated by the monoterpene fractions with 62.479% and 48.021%, respectively. However, the total content of monoterpene fractions in SDE oil was 45.49% and no monoterpene hydrocarbon fractions were determined. On the other hand, SDE oil was dominated by the sesquiterpene fractions, and large amount of the oxygenated sesquiterpene (40.82%) was found. Although different extraction methods produced essential oils with various chemical compositions, there were five major compounds in common, including caryophyllene oxide, neointermedeol, borneol, <i>α</i>-thujone and <i>β</i>-caryophyllene. As shown in <a href="#molecules-24-00483-f001">Figure 1</a>, the total of these five compounds accounted for around 82.93%, 40.90% and 40.33% for SDE, subcritical extraction and hydrodistillation, respectively. Similarly, it is well-documented that caryophyllene oxide, neointermedeol, borneol, <i>α</i>-thujone and <i>β</i>-caryophyllene had the highest contents [ <a href="#B16-molecules-24-00483">16</a>]. Mevy et al. have proved that these components exhibited antioxidant, antibacterial and other biological activities [ <a href="#B17-molecules-24-00483">17</a>]. Additionally, compared with the other two methods, the contents of these common ingredients in SDE essential oil was obviously higher. Usually, traditional essential oil extractions are time consuming and high temperature needed. These methods might lose some volatiles and significantly degrade unsaturated compounds or esters [ <a href="#B18-molecules-24-00483">18</a>]. Similarly, SDE would also result in severe losses of volatile materials, because oil-containing hexane should be subsequently removed by rotary evaporation. </p> </div> <div class="2.3.antimicrobialactivitiesofa.argyiessentialoils" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
2.3. Antimicrobial Activities of A. argyi Essential Oils</div> <p>The antimicrobial activities of <i>A. argyi</i> essential oils determined by the agar disc diffusion assay are listed in <a href="#molecules-24-00483-t003">Table 3</a>. In general, Gram-positive pathogens were much more sensitive to <i>A. argyi</i> essential oil than fungi and Gram-negative pathogens. <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> was the most sensitive bacterium, with an inhibition diameter longer than 15 mm and <i>Escherichia coli</i> was the most inhibited Gram-negative bacterium with an inhibition diameter longer than 9.7 mm. As shown in <a href="#molecules-24-00483-f002">Figure 2</a>, hydrodistillation oil showed strong inhibition against <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>B. subtilis</i>, whereas subcritical extraction oil showed significant inhibition against <i>B. subtilis</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, with inhibition zone diameters of 21.88 and 14.7 mm, respectively. </p> <p>Interestingly, SDE oil showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity with a 13 mm diameter on average. Furthermore, MICs of different <i>A. argyi</i> essential oils against eight microbes were also tested (listed in <a href="#molecules-24-00483-t004">Table 4</a> and shown in <a href="#molecules-24-00483-f003">Figure 3</a>). MICs of SDE oil against most microorganisms were 6.25 μL/mL, peaking at 12.5 μL/mL. In contrast, MICs of hydrodistilled and subcritical extracts were mostly higher than 12.5 μL/mL and several values even reached 25 μL/mL. As the results above indicate, SDE oil showed a higher antimicrobial activity than the other two oils, which suggested that SDE oil could be a good candidate for an antimicrobial agent. Danh et al. reported that the antimicrobial activity of <i>A. argyi</i> essential oil was predominantly controlled by the amount of active compound with high diffusivity in agar medium [ <a href="#B19-molecules-24-00483">19</a>]. During hydrodistillation and subcritical extraction, compounds could be hardly diffused, and those with high hydrophobicities exerted little influence on the antimicrobial activities of resultant oils [ <a href="#B20-molecules-24-00483">20</a>]. The antimicrobial activities of essential oils were apparently related to the large amount of caryophyllene oxide, neointermedeol, borneol, <i>α</i>-thujone and <i>β</i>-caryophyllene. The activity of SDE oil was superior to those of subcritical and hydrodistilled extracts, which displayed lower MICs and larger inhibition zones. Compared with SDE, hydrodistillation needs large quantity of water and higher temperature, which would cause hydrolysis reaction and damage the active compound. Subcritical extraction would bring some miscellaneous ingredients such as wax and pigment. These ingredients might be the reason for the less inhibitory effect of essential oil extracted by subcritical extraction [ <a href="#B12-molecules-24-00483">12</a>]. On the other hand, the highest antimicrobial activity of essential oil extracted by SDE might also be related with <i>n</i>-hexane which has the appropriate polarity to accumulate active antimicrobial ingredients. </p> <p>Taking both of the results from MICs and inhibition zone diameter into consideration, <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>E. coli</i> were the appropriate target bacteria with higher sensitivity. To further investigate the antimicrobial activity of the extracted essential oils, SEM analysis was performed using the two selected sensitive bacteria. As shown in <a href="#molecules-24-00483-f004">Figure 4</a> and <a href="#molecules-24-00483-f005">Figure 5</a>, the images directly exhibited the detrimental inhibitory effect of the essential oil from <i>A. argyi</i> against the tested bacteria. It could be found that, for the most part, control cells were intact and showed a smooth surface or weakly damaged ( <a href="#molecules-24-00483-f004">Figure 4</a>(A4) and <a href="#molecules-24-00483-f005">Figure 5</a>(B4)). In contrast, bacterial cells treated with the <i>A. argyi</i> essential oils were subjected to considerable damage ( <a href="#molecules-24-00483-f004">Figure 4</a>(A1–A3) and <a href="#molecules-24-00483-f005">Figure 5</a>(B1–B3)). Similar results have been reported by Diao et al. [ <a href="#B21-molecules-24-00483">21</a>]. These results revealed that the active compounds from essential oil might bind to the cell surface and then penetrate into the target sites, which could destroy the structure of cell walls. It should be noticed that, as shown in <a href="#molecules-24-00483-f004">Figure 4</a> and <a href="#molecules-24-00483-f005">Figure 5</a>, the cell walls changed much to different extents after treated with the essential oil, while SDE oil showed the strongest inhibitory effect against the strains. </p> </div> </div> <div class="3.materialsandmethods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

3.4. Chemical Analysis of Essential Oil</div> <p>The GC-MS system (Agilent, Little Falls, DE, USA) was composed on a 5975 mass selective detector and a 6890 GC. The GC capillary column was an Agilent HP-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). The injector and detector temperatures were 220 and 260 °C, respectively. The oven temperature was held at 45 °C for 5 min, increased to 250 °C with a flow rate of 3 °C /min, and then held for 10 min.

This was achieved by setting parameters in the MetAlign <sup>TM</sup> interface, where the minimum peak threshold to eliminate noise that would interfere with peak alignment, was determined. Spectral alignment was performed using the rough mode, where ion fragments originating from chromatographic peaks with corresponding retention times were aligned across all samples. </p> </div> <div class="3.5.detectionofantimicrobialactivitybyagardiscdiffusionassay" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

4. Conclusions</div> <p> <i>A. argyi</i> essential oil has aroused attention due to its biological activities. In this study, three methods were applied to extract the essential oil from <i>A. argyi</i> leaves. The effects of each method on the yields, chemical composition and bioactivity were investigated. The yield of SDE extract was nearly 1.2%, which was comparable to the subcritical extract (1%), while much higher than the hydrodstilled oil (0.5%). Although the chemical compounds of the SDE oil was much less than hydrodistilled oil and subcritical extract oil, the major compounds including caryophyllene oxide, neointermedeol, borneol, <i>α</i>-thujone and <i>β</i>-caryophyllene of SDE oil accounted for 82.93%, which was higher than subcritical extraction and hydrodistillation. The antimicrobial activities of these oils were estimated using agar disc diffusion and MIC assays. They showed that SDE oil had a good antimicrobial activity, and the activity against tested microorganisms like <i>L. monocytogenes</i>, <i>E. coli</i>, <i>P. vulgaris</i>, <i>S. enteritidis</i> and <i>A. niger</i> was higher or equal to those of other two extracts. Furthermore, SEM results showed that <i>A. argyi</i> essential oil could destroy the structure of cell walls and the SDE oil had the strongest inhibitory effect against the tested strains. All these results above suggested that SDE <i>A. argyi</i> essential oil had the advantages in yield, bioactive ingredients and antimicrobial activities, which qualified that SDE oil could be a good preservative candidate for the food industry. </p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="fn-group" title="fn-group"> <div class="fn-type-" title=""> <p> <b>Sample Availability:</b> The Leaves of <i>A. argyi</i> Lévl. et Vant were purchased from <i>A. argyi</i> farm (Qichun, China). <i>Artemisia argyi</i> Lévl. et Vant essential oils are available from the authors. </p> </div> </div> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
