<p>The results obtained in this study showed that the molecular profile of the essential oil of
 <italic> A. citriodora</italic> grown in Morocco is slightly variable depending on the region where the plant was harvested.
 <italic> In vitro</italic> tested essential oils of
 <italic> A. citriodora</italic> have a strong cytotoxic activity against P815 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.60 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), compared to MCF7 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 34.72 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) and VERO (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 32.90 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). A moderate antibacterial activity on
 <italic> E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922 and on
 <italic> S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 was recorded. However,
 <italic> P. aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 27853 strain was resistant to these essential oils. Cytotoxic and antibacterial activities depend on the chemical nature and interactions of
 <italic> A. citriodora</italic> essential oil's compounds. Further studies need to be conducted on apoptosis induction, genes expression (Bcl2, p53, Bax, Jun/Fos, etc.), and antitumor activity of the main compounds of
 <italic> A. citriodora</italic> essential oil to understand the involved molecular pathways.
