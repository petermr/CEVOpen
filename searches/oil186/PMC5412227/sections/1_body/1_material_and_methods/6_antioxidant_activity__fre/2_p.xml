<p class="p">% scavenging = 100 - (Abs sample - Abs control)/Abs DPPH × 100 %, where the Abs sample is the absorbance of the sample without DPPH. The oil concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) was calculated from the plot of inhibition percentages against the oil concentrations. The assay was repeated three times.
