<p>The antimicrobial activity of the essential oils could be attributed to the presence of mostly active compounds, such as Geranial (Maksimović et al. 2008; Seth et al., 2012), a-pinene (Dorman and Deans, 2000), Geraniol acetate, Geraniol (Duarte et al. 2007; Singh et al., 2012), Neral (Maksimović et al. 2008; Sartoratto et al. 2004) and Limonene (Inouye et al., 2001). moreover, the components such as trans-Caryophyllene, Germacrene-D, δ-Cadinene, β-Pinene, β-Myrcene and Sabinene which were found in lower levels, could also contribute to the antimicrobial activity of the oils (Aguiar et al. 2013; Dorman and Deans 2000; Oztürk et al. 2009). In fact, the synergistic effects of the diversity between the major and minor constituents present in the essential oils should be taken into consideration in accounting for their biological activity.</p>
