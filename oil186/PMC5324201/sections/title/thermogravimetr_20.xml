 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">TG/DTA 6300 (The Seiko Instrument, USA) thermo gravimetric analyzer was used for monitoring continuous weight change of root powder due to drying, volatilisation and gasification and followed a linear heating program. The DTG and DTA curves were recorded in terms of percentage weight loss per minute and temperature difference in mV (for DT). Powder sample (7.34 mg) was heated in a platinum crucible under the furnace atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 °C/min up to the final temperature performed of 800 °C. The α-Al
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>3</sub> (6 mg) was used as a reference material.
