<p class="p">The 2,2‐diphenyl‐1‐picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging capacity was measured according to Cuendet, Hostettmann, and Potterat (
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). Next, 50 µl of either essential oil or plant extract (at different concentrations in methanol) was mixed with 5 ml of a 0.004% (w/v) DPPH methanolic solution. The reaction was allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min, and absorbance was read against a blank at 517 nm. The inhibitions of the DPPH radical in percent were calculated as follows: 
 <italic class="italic">I </italic>(%) = (
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">blank</sub> − 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">sample</sub>/
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">blank</sub>) × 100, where 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">blank</sub> is the absorbance of the control reaction (containing all reagents except the test sample), and 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 <sub class="sub">sample </sub>is the absorbance value of the essential oil or the extract. Extract or oil concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) was calculated using the graph‐plotted inhibition percentage against the extract or oil concentration. Tests were conducted in duplicate, with gallic acid used as a positive control.
