<p class="p">Chemical analyses (GC and GC/MS) of AcEO allowed the identification of 42 compounds. The chromatographic profile of the essential oil is shown in (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The oil has the spathulenol (10.19%) as main component, followed by ß-eudesmol (4.05%), p-cymene (3.83%), δ-cadinene (3.67%), ß-pinene (2.82%), caryophyllene oxide (2.30%) and salvial-4(14)-en-1-one (2.51%). The compounds mentioned in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> were systematically found in all the samples. The chemical structures of the major chemical components found in AcEO are presented in (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>).
