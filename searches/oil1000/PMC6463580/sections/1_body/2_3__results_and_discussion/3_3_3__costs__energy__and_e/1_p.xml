<p class="p">The reduced cost of extraction is clearly advantageous for MAH method in terms of time and energy. The time required for extraction of the essential oils contained in 100 g of rosemary was found at 180 min for the CH and 20 minutes for the MAH, while the energy required to perform this extraction is 2.25 kWh for the CH and 0.23 kWh for the MAH (
