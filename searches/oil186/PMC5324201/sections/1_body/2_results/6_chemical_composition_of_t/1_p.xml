<p>The essential oil of 
 <italic>A. sowa</italic> was colourless with a characteristic odour. A total of 24 constituents were identified and quantified in the essential oil and its water extract part by GC and GC-MS and the results are shown in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table">9</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table">10</xref> and Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. In this assay, 17 compounds from essential oil and 13 compounds from water extracted part were identified, which accounted for 100% of the total amount. Phenylpropanoids were contributed the major compounds of the essential oil and water extracted portion. Other predominant compound groups like lactone and ester were found in the water extracted part. Hydrocarbons were boiled out and produced an emulsion in the water extracted part which contributed 3.827% in the water extract part and 3.363% in the oily part. Apiol and m-diaminobenzene were the predominant components of the essential oil. In the case of water extracted part, apiol was found the highest component followed by m-diaminobenzene, β-butyrolactone and isobutylactone.
