<p class="p">The aerial parts of oregano were collected in early summer 2014, near the town of Yazd (Yazd Province, Iran). The plant materials were identified by Dr Seyed Mansour Mirtadzadini, a botanist at Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Kerman, Iran. The aerial parts of the plant were dried at room temperature and the essential oil (EO) was extracted by hydrodistillation for approximately 3 h using a Clevenger-type apparatus.</p>
