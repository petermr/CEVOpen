<p class="p">The results presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01897-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> show that in addition to the color, the extracting yield of vetiver oil obtained from CXE extraction is significantly different from the other three methods. The color of CXE oil was pale yellow, mostly approaching the light yellow of traditional HD oil. However, the oil yield of CXE extraction reached almost 7.42%, much larger than the 0.6% for HD, 0.3% to 0.5% for IVD, and around 0.5% for SFE, respectively. Interestingly, the industrially-produced IVD oil exhibited a dark brown color while SFE oil was represented by an unspecific color, which was brown mixed with shades of green, close to an olive color.
