0: We used the newly emerged (< 24 h-old) adults of  C. maculatus to set up the fumigation bioassay.
1: We deposited each ten freshly emerged adults in a Petri dish (diameter 60 mm), which its top covered with filter paper.
2: Based on an initial dose-setting experiment, 2, 3, 5, and 6 l of  E. camaldulensis leaf and flower essential oils (corresponding to essential oil concentrations of 75.7, 113.55, 189.25 and 227.1 l/l air) were applied to the filter paper pieces.
3: We used the same concentrations for both leaf and flower essential oils to be able to compare different effects of essential oils.
4: Then, the Petri dishes' edges were sealed with parafilm.
5: Each concentration and control (without essential oil) was replicated four times.
6: Mortality was recorded at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after treatments.
7: Insects with no movement of leg or antenna were considered as dead 36.
