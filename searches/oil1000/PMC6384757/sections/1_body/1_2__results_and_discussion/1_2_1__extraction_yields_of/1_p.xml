 <italic class="italic">A. argyi</italic> essential oils were extracted with hydrodistillation, subcritical extraction and SDE respectively. Their extraction time, yields and colors were evaluated. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00483-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, SDE took the shortest time (180 min) and gave the highest yield (1.2%), followed by subcritical extraction (1%) and hydrodistillation (0.5%). The yields of these extracted oils were higher than the reported ones, which were around 0.20% to 0.26% [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-00483" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Furthermore, SDE cost 1 h less than hydrodistillation, and 2 h less than subcritical extraction. Compared with the other studies, SDE is a feasible method which offers yield and processing time advantages.
