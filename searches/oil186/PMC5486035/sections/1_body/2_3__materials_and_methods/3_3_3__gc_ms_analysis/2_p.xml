<p>Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was carried out on the same instrument described above coupled with an Agilent 5975C mass detector (Santa Clara, CA, USA), with the same column and the same operative conditions used for the analytical GC. We adjusted the ionization voltage to 70 eV, the electron multiplier to 900 V, and the ion source temperature to 230 °C. Mass spectra data were acquired in the scan mode in an 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> range of 40–300. The compounds were identified based on: their GC retention index (relative to C9–C22 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes on the HP-5MS column), values reported in the literature, the computer matching of their mass spectral data with those of the MS library (NIST 08), the comparison of their MS fragmentation patterns with those reported in literature, and, whenever possible, the co-injection with authentic standards (α-Pinene, 2-Carene, 3-Carene, β-Myrcene and 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene).
