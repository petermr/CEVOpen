 <italic class="italic">R. carthamoides</italic> HR and SGR essential oils were able to protect astrocytes against oxidative stress by the reduction of intracellular ROS levels in LPS-stimulated cells. ROS production is activated by the NADPH oxidase (NOX) [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] and by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) as a side-product in the synthesis of prostanoids [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. It is known from literature that ROS can activate various signaling molecules such as protein kinase C, MAPK, and NF-
 <italic class="italic">κ</italic>B which play an important role in regulating the gene expression of various proinflammatory factors [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The overproduction of ROS may lead to an increase of TNF-
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> level [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. This highlights the relationship between inflammation and oxidative stress.
