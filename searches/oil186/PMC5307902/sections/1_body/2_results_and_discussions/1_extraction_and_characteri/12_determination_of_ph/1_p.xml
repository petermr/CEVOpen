<p>The measurements of pH were obtained from the probe inserted directly into the emulsion container. The evaluation of the pH values has the objective to investigate changes that affect the stability of the formulation. The pH values for emulsions stored at room temperature indicated no important influence on the surfactant composition. However, the storage time promoted a decrease in the pH for all formulations. Throughout the experimental period, the pH of all the formulations reduced, as well as the pH range between the formulations also reduced 2.5-4 (D180) [
