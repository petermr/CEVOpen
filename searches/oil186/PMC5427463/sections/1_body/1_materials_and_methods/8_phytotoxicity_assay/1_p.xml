<p>The biological activity of SoEO was conducted by phytotoxicity assay based on the root/shoot growth and seed germination as described by Moiteiro et al. (2006[
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]). Four vegetable species namely, 
 <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>, 
 <italic>Raphanus sativus</italic>, 
 <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> and 
 <italic>Trigonella</italic>
 <italic> foenum-graecum</italic> were selected for this study. Surface-sterilized seeds from each species (
 <italic>n </italic>= 40) were aseptically transferred on two pre-sterilized layers of Whatman filter paper in petri dishes. After dispensing the essential oil solution to the filter paper, the petri dishes were tightly sealed with parafilm and then incubated at 24 °C, in the dark. Germination was monitored for 7 days and the root/hypocotyl lengths and fresh weights were measured at the end of the experiment (25 digitalized plantlets randomly selected for each experiment) with the application Image J Version 1.37 r, 2010 (
