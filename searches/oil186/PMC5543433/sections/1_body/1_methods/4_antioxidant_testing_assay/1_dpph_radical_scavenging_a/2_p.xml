<p id="Par29">OD
 <sub>blank</sub> is the absorbance of the control reaction containing all reagents except the tested compound. OD
 <sub>sample</sub> is the absorbance of the test compound. Extract concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated from the graph plotting inhibition percentage against extract concentration. Tests were carried out in triplicate.
