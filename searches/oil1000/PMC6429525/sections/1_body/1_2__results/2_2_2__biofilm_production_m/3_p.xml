<p class="p">At either selected concentrations EOs modulated the biofilm production with unpredictable results for each strain. These results anticipated that many EOs may act mainly as biofilm inhibitors in the case of RP62A and O-47 strains, while for 6538P and 25923 EOs can either induce no effect or stimulate biofilm production (

 <xref rid="molecules-24-00890-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, the number of EOs able to inhibit (&lt;100%, &lt;80% and &lt;50%, respectively) or stimulate (≥100%, ≥120%, ≥150% and ≥200%, respectively) biofilm formation is reported. It is worthy to note that on
