 <italic class="italic">Brucella</italic> agar supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. This was done before solidifying the medium at 50 °C. After solidification, 10 μL of bacterial suspension was spread over the plates using a sterile loop. The plates were put into an anaerobic jar under microaerophilic conditions and incubated at 37 °C for 72 h as explained above. All samples were prepared in triplicate. The lowest concentrations of the essential oil or thymol that inhibited visible bacterial growth (containing no colonies) were expressed as minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Plates containing methanol and amoxicillin (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) (50 μg/mL) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively (
