<p class="p">Fresh roots of 
 <italic class="italic">Vetiveria zizanioides</italic>, over 2 years old, were harvested in December 2017 from Lanxi (29.208°N, 119.485°E, 38 m above sea level), Zhejiang, China. The commercial samples of vetiver oil, including light fraction oil (LFO) and heavy fraction oil (HFO), were supplied by a local producer, Natural Perfume Factory, Lanxi, Zhejiang province. The vetiver roots were cleaned to remove the soil, and then were air-dried at room temperature for 48 h. The dried materials were cut into small pieces (the length was less than 1 cm). Then, they were ground into a root powder in liquid nitrogen. The experimental root materials were stored at −20 °C in an ultra-low refrigerator (New Brunswick, Model Innova U725-86, UK).
