<p class="p">Mass spectrometry was accomplished using a Thermo Quest instrument with a quadrupole detector under the same conditions as for chromatography mentioned above. Mass spectra were analyzed at 70 eV ionization energy. Retention indices of peaks were computed using retention times of an n-alkane ladder that was injected after the essential oil. Compounds were identified by comparison of their mass spectra and their retention indices with those reported in the literature or computer library (
