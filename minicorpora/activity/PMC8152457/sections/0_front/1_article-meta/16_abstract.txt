0: Sperm preservation is a crucial factor for the success of assisted reproductive technology (ART) in humans, livestock, and wildlife.
1: Irrespective of the extender and the storage conditions used, semen handling and preservation negatively affect sperm quality.
2: Moreover, oxidative stress, which often arises during semen storage, significantly reduces sperm function and compromises the sperm fertilizing ability by inducing oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids.
3: Plant extracts have recently emerged as a cheap and natural source of additives to preserve and enhance sperm function during semen storage.
4: The present work provides an update on the use of these natural compounds as alternative additives for sperm preservation in 13 animal species, including humans.
5: A detailed description of the effects of 45 plant species, belonging to 28 families, on sperm function during semen storage is presented.
6: The plant material and extraction method employed, dosage, possible toxic effects, and antimicrobial properties are provided.
