<p>The superoxide anion scavenging activity of the sample was determined according to Barreca et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The reaction mix was composed of 1.0 mL of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) solution (156 μM NBT in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4), 1.0 mL of β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) solution (468 μM in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4), and 20 µL of sample solution (range 60–3.75 µg/mL). The reaction was started by adding 100 μL phenazine methosulphate (PMS) solution (60 μM PMS in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) to the mixture. The reaction mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 5 min, and absorbance at 560 nm was measured against blank samples with a Varian Cary 50 UV-VIS spectrophotometer. The inhibition (%) of radical scavenging activity was calculated using Equation (1).
