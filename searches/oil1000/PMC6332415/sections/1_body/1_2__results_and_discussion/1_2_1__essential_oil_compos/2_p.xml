<p class="p">The differences in oil content and composition may be attributed to factors related to ecotype, phenophases, temperature, relative humidity, photoperiod, irradiance, genotype, and agronomic conditions (harvesting time, plantage, crop density). In the north Indian plains carvone content varies between 45.9% and 77.1% [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The percentage of carvone also varies in the essential oil of spearmint growing in different countries, e.g., Egypt (46.4%–68.55%) [

The main components were carvone (76.65%), limonene (9.57%), cis-dihydrocarvone (2.04%), and 1,8-cineole (1.93%). In Egypt, Omar
