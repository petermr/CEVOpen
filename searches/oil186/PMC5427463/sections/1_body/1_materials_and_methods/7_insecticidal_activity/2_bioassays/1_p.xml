<p class="p">The insecticidal activity of the SoEO, against the third instar larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> and the adults of 
 <italic class="italic">T. castaneum</italic>, was determined by fumigant bioassay using closed container method. A group of 10 larvae or adults were put into the bottom of plastic container of 40 mL. Treatments (concentrations of SoEO 0, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 400 µl/L air) were applied to paper discs, attached at the top of the container, which will be closed. The concentrations quoted above and further in this paper correspond to the volume of the essential oil put on the filter and the volume of the air in the container. Five replicates of each concentration and the control were made. Mortality was recorded after 48 h of the treatment for both 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis </italic>larvae and 
 <italic class="italic">T. castaneum</italic> adults and the fifty percent lethal concentration (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) was calculated from pooled raw data by probit analysis using programs written in the R. Language (Venables and Smith, 2004[
