<p>The most representative compounds class was sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (56.3–82.0%) in all samples from Caxianuã Forest (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-18-01081-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The 
 <italic>O. caudata</italic> oils showed different chemical profiles in the tissues; in the EO from leaves (
 <bold>Cau-L</bold>) the monoterpene hydrocarbons (21.5%) were present, while in the branches (
 <bold>Cau-B</bold>) there was a high accumulation of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (35.9%). The EO of 
 <italic>O. cujumary</italic> leaves (
 <bold>Cuj-L</bold>) showed higher concentrations of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (25.8%) than branches (
 <bold>Cuj-B</bold>, 4.0%), which showed significant amounts of monoterpene hydrocarbons (22.7%) and fatty acid derivatives (34.6%). The 
 <italic>O. caniculata</italic> oils showed amounts of phenylpropanoids, especially in the branches (
 <bold>Can-B</bold>, 15.5%). Seventy volatile components were identified, comprising approximately 95.1% of the total composition of the oils (
