<p class="p">96-well microtiter plates utilizing broth microdilution method was applied for the minimum inhibitory (MIC) and minimum bactericidal (MBC) concentrations determination. In a typical procedure, the bacterial strains were cultured overnight at 37 °C on MHB, adjusted to a final density of 8 log CFU/mL, and used to inoculate (1-10) 96-well microtiter plates containing serial dilutions of the essential oils (5120-20 μg/m1) on MHB. A positive control containing the bacterial culture and broth without the plant oils was included in each test. The contents of each well were mixed on a plate shaker at 300 r/min for 30 seconds and then incubated at 37 C for 24 h, while 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Streptococcus mutans</italic> were incubated for 48 h. Then, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma, T8877) was used for the visual indicator of bacterial growth. The MIC of the essential oils was regarded as the lowest concentration showing no growth.
