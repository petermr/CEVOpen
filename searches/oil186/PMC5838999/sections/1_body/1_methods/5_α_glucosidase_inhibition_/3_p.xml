<p id="Par33">For the kinetics study, the reaction mixture was performed as described above, except that the substrate concentration increased from 0.625 to 10 mM, and in the presence of different concentrations of essential oil (7.5, 15 and 30 μg/mL). The reaction was started by the addition of enzyme, and monitored at 405 nm, at 5 min intervals during 30 min. The initial reaction rates were determined using calibration curves constructed by varying 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenol concentrations. The results were used to construct Lineweaver–Burk plots to determine the type of inhibition, Michaelis-Menten constant (K
 <sub>m</sub>) and maximum velocity (V
 <sub>max</sub>) values. The values of inhibition constant (
 <italic>Ki</italic>) were determined from the secondary plots constructed using slopes or y-intercepts of Lineweaver–Burk plots. (Ki) expresses the equilibrium constant for the binding of RaEO to α-glucosidase.
