<p>The extracellular pH of 
 <italic>F. sporotrichioides</italic> cells is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>. A gradual increase in extracellular pH was observed in control in 30, 60, and 90 min. The extracellular pH values in the 
 <italic>F. sporotrichioides</italic> suspensions after incubation with MPE at MIC and MFC for 30 min were 4.70 and 4.55, respectively, which were significantly lower than that of the control (5.5). The extracellular pH in 
 <italic>F. sporotrichioides</italic> suspensions incubation with MPE at MIC and MFC for 60 min was 4.90 and 4.60, respectively, which were significantly lower than that of the control (5.8). And finally, the extracellular pH in 
 <italic>F. sporotrichioides</italic> suspensions incubation with MPE at MIC and MFC for 90 min was 5.0 and 4.50, respectively, which were significantly lower than that of the control (5.5).
