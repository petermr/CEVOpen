<p class="p">In this sense, the quantification of EO by HPLC has been limited by the high volatility and low UV absorptivity that most of these components have, presenting a greater application in the analysis of its nonvolatile components or other natural products (i.e., extracts) [

In contrast, gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has been used, given the ionization properties of the volatile components of the EO; however, it is an analytical technique that presents difficulties in the identification of the signals of these complex samples due to the fact that many terpenes have identical mass spectra as a consequence of the close similarities in fragmentation patterns and rearrangements after ionization, in addition to having a prolonged analysis time and high cost.
