<p class="p">The CXE vetiver oil presented an approximately similar antioxidant activity as traditional oil. Based on the other references [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-01897" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], the presence of β-vetivenene can justify the slight ability of IVD oil (0.73%) and the strong antioxidant activity of HD oil (3.89%). The essential oil obtained by the SFE method has weak antioxidant activity because of its poor chemical composition, which was predominantly composed of hydrocarbons [
