<p>The major molecules dominating the chemical composition of essential oils are caryophyllene oxide, 
 <italic>β</italic>-spathulenol, Ar-curcumene, neral, and cis-verbenol (

 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, isoledene, elemene, 1.8-cineole, copaene, and nerol are also present with variable ratios. Unlikely, limonene and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, which are compounds constantly found in
 <italic> A. citriodora</italic> essential oils distilled in Morocco at proportions of 14% for the first and 3% for the second, are present in the studied essential oils in the present work at very low averaging rates of 0.02% to 0.5%. In fact, the compositions of the essential oils depend on the operating (drying, extraction methods) and on the harvest and the storage conditions [
