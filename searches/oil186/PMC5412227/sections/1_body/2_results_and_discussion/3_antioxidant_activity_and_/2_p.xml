<p class="p">The high antioxidant activity of 
 <italic class="italic">D. kotschy</italic> essential oils can be attributed to their richness in monoterpenes (70%), especially oxygenated monoterpenes (43%). Previous studies also revealed that essential oils with high percentage of monoterpenes (Ghasemi Pirbalouti et al., 2014; Luís, et al., 2016) exhibit antioxidant activities, which is in good agreement with our results. The current results suggest that synergistic activities of multiform unsaturated compounds of essential oils can be responsible for their antioxidant activity.
