<p>Lymphocytes were isolated from heparinized whole blood collected from healthy volunteers, who provided written medical histories through a standardized questionnaire and had not taken anti-inflammatory medication or nutritional supplements. Blood samples were diluted with equal volumes of balanced salt solution, layered over Histopaque-1077 in centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 400×

Lymphocytes (viability &gt; 90%) were counted on a haemocytometer and suspended in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin G and streptomycin. Cell concentration was adjusted to 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL.
