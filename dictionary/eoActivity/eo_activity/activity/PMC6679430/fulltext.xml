It possesses several virulence factors that are associated with its cariogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. An essential factor of <italic>S.mutans</italic> is its sucrose-dependent and glucan-mediated colonization of tooth surfaces. Glucans are glucose polymers synthesized by extracellular glucosyltransferases (gtfs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. There are three <italic>S.mutans</italic> gtf&#x02019;s: gtf B and gtf C synthesize primarily water-insoluble glucans (WIG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and gtf D, synthesize water-soluble glucans (WSG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Gtfs are involved in many biological processes such as cell-cell communications, signal transduction, immune response, microbial adhesion and infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Biofilm or dental plaque is formed through two different sequential steps: initial and reversible cell-to-surface attachment and subsequent sucrose-dependent adhesion of the microorganisms, which is firm and irreversible, gtfs are strongly involved in the latter step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]<bold>.</bold> There are multiple ways that compounds can exert anticaries action in addition to gtf inhibition. In view of essential roles played by gtfs, intervention of gtfs has attracted remarkable interest among other ways for drug development since inhibitors of gtfs can potentially interfere with the pathological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Targeting gtf enzymes prevents the synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides (glucans) and is an attractive strategy for the development of anti-biofilm compounds, as the glucans are extremely important in the processes of biofilm formation and stabilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">The use of medicinal plants or natural products has been one of the most successful strategies for the discovery of new medicines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].
