<p>Knowledge of the composition and size of the soil seed bank of disturbed areas is essential in order to understand aboveground dynamics and to predict their future floristic composition [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The presence of exotic species in altered areas of roadsides has consequences for seed bank composition and diversity [

 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Some studies have reported that homogenized and altered habitats invaded by exotic species showed changes in composition and a decrease in the abundance of native species in the seed bank, thus impoverishing community diversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For example, in grasslands of Achill Island (on the west coast of Ireland), it was found that the seed banks of sectors invaded by 
 <italic>Gunnera tinctoria</italic> were less diverse and abundant than in non-invaded areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although most studies report changes in species composition, the changes in richness of native species are not always evident [
 <xref rid="pone.0246657.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Characterization of the seed bank of the native, exotic, and invasive species found in disturbed environments is important for prediction of the recruiting potential of these species from the bank, as well as the future dynamics of the vegetation in the wake of new disturbances [
