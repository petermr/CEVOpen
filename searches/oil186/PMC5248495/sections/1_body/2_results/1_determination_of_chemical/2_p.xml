<p class="p">According to the data obtained, 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">purpureum</italic> contains 57.3% methyl chavicol, with the second largest component being linalool (18%). This places the given variety of 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> into methyl chavicol-rich chemotype. 
 <italic class="italic">O. basilicum</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">thyrsiflora</italic> belongs to linalool-rich chemotype, with concentrations of linalool and methyl chavicol being 68 and 20% respectively. These data are in a good accordance with the results reported by Sishu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. For the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">O.</italic> x 
 <italic class="italic">citriodorum</italic> species the predominant constituents were identified to be citral (21%) and nerol (23%), therefore it could not be classified as belonging to any of the chemotypes mentioned above, but will rather form its own, nerol-rich chemotype. The data on 
 <italic class="italic">O.</italic> x 
 <italic class="italic">citriodorum</italic> are somewhat consistent with the similar results published by Carović-Stanko et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>] on essential oil distilled from the plant of the same species, except for the fact that there were more than 45 constituents of 
 <italic class="italic">O.</italic> x 
 <italic class="italic">citriodorum</italic> essential oil identified in the present study, as opposed to 20 components identified by Carović-Stanko et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>].
