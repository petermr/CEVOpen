Introduction</title><p><italic>Cordyceps</italic>, derived from two Latin words &#x0201c;cord&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;ceps&#x0201d; representing &#x02018;club&#x02019; and &#x02018;head&#x02019; respectively, describing it as club fungi. It is an entomopathogenic fungus where extensions of the stroma and fruiting body arise from insect larvae carcasses [<xref rid="B1-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. <italic>Cordyceps</italic> predominantly lives on the head of larvae of a particular moth species, <italic>Hepialus armoricanus Oberthur</italic> (Lepidoptera). It belongs to the Ascomycetes family and has been a very well-known fungus in Chinese traditional medicine for the last 300 years. <italic>Cordyceps</italic> is also known as &#x02018;Dong Chong Xia Cao&#x02019;, which means &#x02018;Worm in winter and grass in summer&#x02019; in China [<xref rid="B2-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. According to the previous reports, around 1200 types of entomopathogenic fungi are known, out of which, <italic>Cordyceps</italic> is considered as one of the largest genus containing approximately 500 species. Several species of <italic>Cordyceps</italic> have been cultivated for their therapeutic properties such as <italic>Cordyceps sinensis, Cordyceps sobolifera, Cordyceps cicadicola, Cordyceps liangshanesis, Cordyceps ophioglossoides and Cordyceps militaris</italic> [<xref rid="B5-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. On the other hand, keeping in mind the therapeutic value, its major distribution location at approximately 14,000 ft altitude in the Himalayan regions of China, Nepal, Tibet and India makes it very expensive at around USD ($) 12,000 kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> [<xref rid="B3-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B6-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moreover, despite the harvesting difficulties and distribution, it is still considered a highly valued mushroom because of its abundant natural bioactive component resources with various potent biological activities and nutraceutical importance [<xref rid="B2-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For hundreds of years, <italic>Cordyceps</italic> were used as a folk tonic food, but only in recent times, its potential pharmaceutical as well as nutraceutical application have been explored, which has attracted food scientists globally [<xref rid="B8-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Currently, it has been observed that a majority of the population from developed as well as developing countries are suffering from chronic diseases, and the underlying causes are believed to be rapid urbanization and changes in eating and lifestyle behavior. Among the various underline causes, eating habits are considered one of the major risk factors for chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and many more affecting both wellness and the wellbeing of mankind [<xref rid="B9-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, the scientific community is working relentlessly to develop naturally occurring or naturally derived product, such as nutraceuticals, which could help in improving the human health status while not possessing harmful effects. <italic>Cordyceps</italic> are among the thousands of mushroom available containing various bioactive components with innumerable health benefits [<xref rid="B11-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It has been used for its therapeutic values since long time and new promising features of cordycepin-based nutraceuticals are an advantage for the current population. There is a very well-known quote from Hippocrates stating that, &#x0201c;Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food&#x0201d;, describing the importance of nutrition for the prevention, treatment and management of diseases.

Cordycepin and Diabetes</title><p>Diabetes has recently become one of the most prevalent epidemics worldwide, affecting almost 382 million people. According to the reports, it is believed that every year approximately 1.3 million people die from diabetes. According to International Diabetes Federation (IDF), it is estimated that around 629 million people will be diabetic around the globe by 2045. However, as per the recommendation from dieticians or physicians, a healthy life style and healthy food habits, could be one of the key answers to this problem [<xref rid="B60-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].

Currently, pharmaceutical products used for the management or therapeutic purposes against diabetes are sulfonylureas, biguanides, thiazolidinedione, &#x003b1;-glucosidase inhibitors or insulin injections. However, pharmaceutical products available for the treatment of diabetes have several adverse effects and their potency is sometimes controversial. Other non-medicinal strategies used in diabetes are exercise, weight loss plans and changes in food habits. Occasionally, complications of diabetes can cause morbidity because of pathophysiology flaws. Therefore, consumer interest has currently moved towards alternative medicinal approaches such as nutraceutical food products containing bioactive antidiabetic components. Some studies have reported that extract of <italic>C. militaris</italic> showed a significant decrease in blood glucose levels by virtue of increasing glucose metabolism as well as protection against diabetic nephropathy [<xref rid="B64-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p><p>The mechanism of cordycepin&#x02019;s antidiabetic activity is not fully understood, but a few studies have explained a possible pathway. They found that cordycepin prevents the production of NO and pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6 in LPS activated macrophages by inhibiting the protein expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. By virtue of this the expression of type 2 diabetes-regulating genes (11&#x003b2;-HSD1 and PPAR&#x003bb;) was reduced. Expression of co-stimulatory molecules such as ICAM-1 and B7-1/-2 was also decreased with the increase in cordycepin concentration as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02735-f004">Figure 4</xref>A [<xref rid="B65-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].

Cordycepin and Cardiovascular Diseases (Hyperlipidemia)</title><p>Cardiovascular diseases have become one of the major causes of death around the world in developed as well as developing countries, and it has been assumed that there are various factors (excessive intake of tobacco, alcoholism, sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy eating habits etc.) associated with it. Among the various risk factors, rises in lipid levels are believed to be one of the main ones causing this chronic disease [<xref rid="B71-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Hyperlipidemia is caused by or considered as the amount of fatty acids present in lipids, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, trans fats and triglycerides accumulated in human bodies causing cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease [<xref rid="B72-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="B73-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="B74-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Moreover, a mechanistic approach involved in the regulation of fat metabolism is due to AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a main cell electricity sensor [<xref rid="B75-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In addition, activation of AMPK causes a decline in levels of fatty acids through phosphorylation and inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which helps in regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis and oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02735-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). AMPK activation was also reported to decrease total cholesterol and triglycerides by inhibiting the activity of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) and HMG CoA reductase, the two rate-limiting enzymes in TC and TG synthesis, respectively [<xref rid="B76-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Wu et al. [<xref rid="B77-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] proposed that cordycepin could additionally prevent intracellular lipid accumulation through activation of AMPK interplay with the &#x00194;1 subunit [<xref rid="B77-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Thus, it was found that regulation of AMPK would provide a solution for overweight and obese people causing hyperlipidemia [<xref rid="B78-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. According to previous reports, cordycepin has been found very effective in lipid reduction, due to its chemical structural similarity with adenosine (an activator of AMPK). Similarly, administration of cordycepin was able to reduce the accumulation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides effectively, and could be a potent nutraceutical agent for reducing hyperlipidemia caused by high fat diets [<xref rid="B79-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="B80-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. On the other hand, cordycepin was also evaluated for regulating autophagy as well as lipid metabolism. It has been found that cordycepin was effective against hepatic lipid accumulation induced by PA through autophagy induction and PKA/mTOR pathway could be the possible mechanism behind its efficacy. More importantly, it was observed that cordycepin was largely effective in reducing the intracellular levels of total lipids, total cholesterol, C and TG, LDL-C, VLDL-C as well as LDL-C/HDL-C and TC/HDL-C ratios. Therefore, cordycepin lipid-lowering activity could be of potential use in the treatment of hyperlipidemia [<xref rid="B77-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="B79-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="B81-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec6dot3-molecules-25-02735"><title>6.3.

Cordycepin has been reported to stimulate cytokine release of resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as well as influence PBMCs proliferation and transcription factors in a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1).

It increases the risk of fracture, as bones become more porous and fragile. Osteoporosis mainly occurs in aged people, specifically in post-menopausal women and patients who had long-term treatment of steroid therapy. Anti-osteoporotic effect of cordycepin was studied in ovariectomized osteopenic rats, it has been found that cordycepin was able to counteract the loss of bone in the experimental model. The mechanistic approach used in this study showed the decline in activity of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase enzymes both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, the results showed that oral intake of cordycepin could increase the level of osteocalcin (OC), a marker of bone formation, and decrease C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) level, a marker of bone resorption, as well as restore oxidative stress levels in ovariectomized rats [<xref rid="B104-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>].

Cordycepin and Anti-Arthritic Effect</title><p>Arthritis, an autoimmune disease affecting bone joints, is mainly characterized by joint stiffness as well as joint pain, among other symptoms such as swelling, warmth, redness, and reduction in joint motility. There is no known specific effective treatment for arthritis, although many drugs such as glucocorticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and other biological agents are used to improve the symptoms, such as pain, fatigue, and disability. Long-term usage of these drugs decreases their effectiveness and increases side effects. Recently, studies were conducted looking for effective anti-arthritic drugs with increased therapeutic effects and fewer side effects. Traditional herbal medicine, which is shown to be more effective, safer, and economical, has attracted more attention in the area of arthritis treatment. Moreover, cordycepin has been found to modulate glycosaminoglycan (GAG) release by suppressing stimulation of IL-1&#x003b2;. In addition, levels of proteases that have been reported in cartilage matrix degradation, such as MMP-13, cathepsin K, MMP-1, cathepsin S, ADAMTS-5 and ADAMTS-4, were decreased by cordycepin in a dose-dependent manner.

Safety and Efficacy</title><p><italic>Cordyceps</italic>, a well-known traditional Chinese medicine is also called a miracle mushroom because of its exceptional health benefits. Due to its natural occurrence, it is considered pharmacologically safe for human consumption. However, in some cases it has been reported to cause dry mouth, nausea, abdominal distension, throat discomfort, headache and diarrhea as well as allergic reactions [<xref rid="B22-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B34-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B145-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. It is recommended to avoid its consumption in the case of patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, there are a few reports indicating that <italic>Cordyceps</italic> intake can cause lead poisoning in some cases. Considering the potential for toxicity, resistance and its efficiency, potential drug derivatives designed from the natural products for the adenosine deaminase-resistant properties and low-toxicity causing effects of cordycepin, as well as organ-targeted nanoparticles for cordycepin delivery for <italic>in vivo</italic> therapy, are also needed [<xref rid="B146-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>].

The mechanism of action of cordycepin still needs further detailed scientific studies along with exploration of the various biochemical pathways involved. Thereby, its pharmacological and mechanism of actions will help in scientific scrutiny to answer every aspect of cordycepin [<xref rid="B34-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Aside from some negative reports and clinical data, <italic>Cordyceps</italic> is still relatively considered safe and non-toxic for human consumption [<xref rid="B22-molecules-25-02735" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec9-molecules-25-02735"><title>9. Conclusions and Future Perspectives</title><p>Over the past few years, people have shown confidence and trust in naturally occurring food-based products such as nutraceuticals for the treatment or management of various chronic diseases. Medicinal mushrooms have been proved to be very effective against numerous serious ailments. <italic>Cordyceps</italic>, some of the most important medicinal mushrooms, have been in use in the traditional Chinese medicine system since a long time ago. They are considered an excellent reservoir of various bioactive components, of which cordycepin is believed to have the most nutraceutical potential. Based on several research reports, cordycepin indicates its nutraceutical values by showing possible therapeutic activity against various diseases by modulating a number of cellular signaling pathways due to its redox behavior. In future, it would be important to uncover other unknown molecules present in <italic>Cordyceps</italic> and to understand their therapeutic potential. Likewise, it is equally important for the scientific community to explore the possibilities of nano-biotechnology-mediated targeted drug delivery systems for cordycepin and how to enhance its bioavailability. Further experimental and clinical studies are required to identify the exact mechanism behind the role of cordycepin, as well as its efficacy and safety alone and in combination. Since <italic>Cordyceps</italic> are edible, they will play a key role in the prevention and cure of various ailments caused by metabolic disorders or infections.</p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, S.A.A., A.E.O.E., M.A., and S.H.; resources, A.E.O.E., A.M.A., M.S.A., and A.J.S.; data curation, A.J.S., M.P., A.E.O.E., A.M. and M.S.; visualization, M.S.A., M.A. and M.P.; writing&#x02014;initial draft, S.A.A., M.P., M.S., A.M.A. and A.J.S.; writing&#x02014;review and final editing, S.A.A., M.A., and M.S.; supervision, M.A. and S.H.
