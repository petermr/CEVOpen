<p>The light yellow essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation of dried 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> rhizomes with a yield of 0.83% (v/w). The chemical compositions of essential oil were analyzed by GC-MS and the result was presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. In total, 30 components were identified, representing 94.7% of the total amount. The α-cyperone (38.46%), cyperene (12.84%) and α-selinene (11.66%) was found to be the major components in the essential oil of 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> rhizomes, followed by β-caryophyllene oxide (4.33%), (d)-limonene (3.62%), α-calacorene (3.14%), and γ-muurolene (3.13%), besides, other components (0.13–1.58%) were found to be lower content in the essential oil in the present study (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The profile obtained in the present study was very similar to the previous results reported by Liu 
 <italic>et al</italic>. who found that α-cyperone (29.38%), cyperene (13.97%), caryophyllene oxide (6.71%) and β-selinene (6.47%) were the major compounds in the essential oil from Zhejiang province in China
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Aghassi 
 <italic>et al</italic>. reported that cyperene (37.9%) and cyperotundone (11.2%) were the major components from oil of 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> grown in Iran
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The rhizome oils of 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> from Tunisia were reported to have cyperotundone (19.7%), cyperene (15.2%), mustakone (5.8%), caryophyllene oxide (2.6%), rotundene (3.6%) and eudesma 5-en-11-α-ol (2.6%)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Lawal and Oyedeji reported that there was an obvious difference in components of essential oil between two different locations both in the Kwa-Zulu Natal Province of South Africa
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. These differences in components and its content of essential oil from 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> rhizome may be concerned in the chemotypes

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> of essential oil. According to previous research results that the volatile compounds of 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> has been divided into four types four chemotypes (H-, K-, M-, O-types)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, the essential oil in the present study should belong to the M-type because it mainly contained α-cyperone, cyperene, caryophyllene oxide, and β-selinene.
