<p class="p">For all three sites, Loufoulakari (L), Campus rural (C), and Sese (S), it is observed that the behavior of the five main major constituents is identical for the aerial parts. During periods of significant rainfall decreases, May (m) and July (j), the 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">trans‐p</italic>‐mentha‐1(7),8‐dien‐2‐ol isomers are produced in large quantities (on average, the content is of the order of 18%), and the content of the 
 <italic class="italic">trans‐p</italic>‐mentha‐2,8‐dien‐1‐ol isomer (around of 5%) decreased in the same period for the Lm, Cm, Sm, Lj, Cj, and Sj samples (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn3459-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Moreover, for the three sites, the results show that the type of soil does not influence the production of the main major constituents. In the zone of “plateau des Cataractes” where the harvests were performed, the average temperature is 22°C (min 15°C, max 26°C) during the dry season and 28°C (min 23°C, max 33°C) during the rainy season (Samba Kimbata, 
 <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1978</xref>). It is, therefore, possible to consider that the factors related to the sunlight and to the water stress have an impact on the quantitative production of these isomers. The drastic decrease in rainfall is already an important factor influencing the yield of essential oil, and in this case, the composition of essential oil is also affected. There is a natural selection in the biosynthesis of isomers favoring the synthesis of 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">trans‐p</italic>‐mentha‐1 (7),8‐dien‐2‐ol during periods of water stress. The separation of the isomers by conventional methods of chemistry is not always easy, these results show that it just to extract the essential oil from the plant material harvested during the water stress period for obtaining extracts enriched in 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">trans‐p</italic>‐mentha‐1(7),8‐dien‐2‐ol and poor in 
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">trans‐p</italic>‐mentha‐2,8‐dien‐1‐ol. This is one of the first possible steps in the separation of four isomers of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>‐menthadienol.
