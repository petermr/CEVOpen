<p>The free-radical scavenging capacity against TPTZ radical was performed according to Smeriglio et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Twenty-five microliters (25 µL) of sample solution (range 150–25 µg/mL) was added to 1.5 mL of daily fresh FRAP reagent pre-warmed at 37 °C, and the absorbance was recorded at 593 nm by an UV-VIS Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1601) after an incubation time of 4 min at 20 °C, with the FRAP reagent used as blank. The inhibition (%) of radical scavenging activity was calculated using Equation (1).
