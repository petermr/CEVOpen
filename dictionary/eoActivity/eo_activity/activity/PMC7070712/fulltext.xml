Major ROS include O<sub>2</sub>&#x02022;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and &#x02022;OH [<xref rid="B72-antioxidants-09-00101" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. In addition to ROS, reactive nitrogen species (RNS), including peroxynitrite (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>), NO, and S-nitrosothiols, also contribute to the generation of oxidative stress. Both ROS and RNS arise as intermediates in several metabolic processes and are specifically produced as part of the cellular defense against invasive pathogens. Free radicals also regulate many processes, including cellular growth, glucose metabolism, and proliferation [<xref rid="B73-antioxidants-09-00101" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].</p><p>Apart from certain beneficial effects, free radicals induce various deleterious effects. In a non-specific manner, ROS can react on significant biomolecules, which leads to deleterious effects like a loss of enzyme activity, genetic mutations and permeability alterations in the cell membrane, and RNS-induced protein <italic>S</italic>-nitrosylation [<xref rid="B74-antioxidants-09-00101" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Because DNA is constantly attacked by the free radicals, around 75,000 to 100,000 DNA damage events might occur in each cell per day. &#x02022;OH is the most reactive species and interacts with all biological molecules, including the C-8 position of guanine to form 8-hydroxyguanine, which is one of the most frequently found oxidized bases in DNA [<xref rid="B75-antioxidants-09-00101" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>].</p><p>An increase in the free radical concentration in the body can cause subsequent oxidative and cellular damage to lipids, proteins, RNA, and DNA [<xref rid="B76-antioxidants-09-00101" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].

Mitochondrial Dysfunction</title><p>Mitochondria are the primary source of high-energy metabolism within the cell. Mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of the living cell.

All these events eventually lead to cell death [<xref rid="B81-antioxidants-09-00101" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. It is currently believed that the majority of ROS are generated by mitochondrial complexes I and III, likely due to the release of electrons by NADH and dihydroflavine-adenine dinucleotide (FADH<sub>2</sub>) into the electron transport chain (ETC). Mitochondrial dysfunction is a characteristic of all chronic diseases and aging. It is characterized by a loss of efficiency in the ETC, as well as reductions in the synthesis of high-energy molecules [<xref rid="B82-antioxidants-09-00101" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>].

Rutin, quercetin, kaempferol, and apigenin, present in leaf extracts of <italic>M. koenigii</italic>, showed the dose-dependent inhibition of endogenous 26S proteasome activity in MDA-MB-231 cells [<xref rid="B52-antioxidants-09-00101" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Therefore, <italic>M. koenigii</italic> contains remarkable anticancer compounds, especially mahanine, which has been reported to show anticancer activity targeting different signaling pathways [<xref rid="B46-antioxidants-09-00101" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Girinimbine, a carbazole alkaloid, has been found to have a good role in total leukocyte migration and result in an appreciable reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels.

Additionally, it stabilizes the levels of protective antioxidant enzymes like SOD, catalase (CAT), and GSH, and inhibits LPO in the forebrain regions of reserpine-treated animals. Furthermore, it has been shown to significantly inhibit reserpine-induced abnormalities in behavior. Similarly, treatment with <italic>M. koenigii</italic> significantly restored the levels of protective antioxidant enzymes (that is, SOD, CAT, and GSH) and inhibited LPO in the forebrain region when compared with reserpine, and it also inhibited catalepsy induced by haloperidol [<xref rid="B36-antioxidants-09-00101" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Isolongifolene (ILF), a tricyclic sesquiterpene of <italic>M. koenigii</italic>, has been reported to render neuroprotective effects against rotenone-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in a cellular model. Cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction were also attenuated by ILF in SH-SY5Y cells, which down-regulated Bax and caspases-3, -6, -8, and -9 expression, and up-regulated Bcl-2 expression. IFL was proved to regulate p-P13K, p-AKT, and p-GSK-3 beta expressions [<xref rid="B87-antioxidants-09-00101" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Preclinical studies have reported that <italic>M. koenigii</italic> leaves could enhance memory in rats [<xref rid="B119-antioxidants-09-00101" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. The possible neuroprotective potential of amethanolic extract of <italic>M. koenigii</italic> leaves was exhibited in a two-vessel occlusion (2VO) rat model of partial global cerebral ischaemia. The Morris water maze test was implemented to assess the rats&#x02019; cognitive function postoperatively. Brain samples were histopathologically examined for viable neurons within the CA1 hippocampal region.

Conclusions</title><p>The current review summarizes the medicinal uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacological properties of <italic>M. koenigii</italic>. <italic>M. koenigii</italic> is a source of several bioactive compounds, including alkaloids, polyphenol, terpenoids, and flavonoids. <italic>M. koenigii</italic> and its derivatives appear to exhibit appreciable pharmacological activities, like anticarcinogenic, proapoptotic, antiangiogenic, antimetastatic, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant properties. The molecular mechanisms underlying these activities of <italic>M. koenigii</italic> and its derivatives are due to their diversified role in combinations of cell signaling pathways at multiple levels in various diseases. <italic>M. koenigii</italic> and its derivatives mitigate oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and cognitive dysfunctions. However, like other polyphenols, to a certain extent, <italic>M. koenigii</italic> activities are limited by its bioavailability and in such conditions, enhancement of the efficiency should be conducted. Therefore, future studies need to include more experimental studies on bioavailability and efficiency enhancement in clinical investigations.</p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>R.B., writing&#x02014;original draft preparation; D.V., writing&#x02014;review and editing; S.-H.J., table preparation; P.G., validation; I.S.-K., interpreted the figures; D.-K.C., supervision of the review and approval of the final draft.
