<p>A total of 40 volatile constituents were identified, fully characterized, and grouped in four classes: monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and others (non-terpenoidic compounds). The major components of HEO were 4-Carene (31.743%), α-Pinene (23.584%), 
 <sc>d</sc>-Limonene (8.002%), and 3-Carene (7.731%), all monoterpenes hydrocarbons that represented 86.591% of the HEO, followed by oxygenated monoterpenes, which presented an average value of 8.235% with α-Terpineol (4.036%), Borneol (0.831%), and α-Pinene oxide (0.787%) as the main compounds.
