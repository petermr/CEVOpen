<p>It is interestingly noticeable that some of the compounds, such as a-Thujene, a-Phellandrene, β-Pinene, β-Myrcene, l-Limonene and γ-Terpinene decreased in quantity with altitudinal increase, while constituents like a-Pinene increase in quantity with a decrease in altitude. Interestingly, several sesquiterpene constituents like Heptanol &lt;2,6-dimethyl-2-&gt;, (-)-a-Santalal and a-cadinene, which were observed at high altitude, were not observed in low altitude. In contrast, some oxygenated monoterpenes such as Verbenol, Pinocarvone, p-Mentha-1,5-dien-8-ol, Myrtenal, trans-Myrtenol, trans-Carveol and trans-3-Caren -2-ol were only detected at low altitudes (
