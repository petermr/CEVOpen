 <italic class="italic">Rhaponticum carthamoides</italic> (Willd.) Iljin (Asteraceae) has been used for centuries in traditional Siberian medicine in the case of overstrain and weakness after illness [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The plant has demonstrated several biological activities, including adaptogenic, antioxidant, anticancer, and antimicrobial effects [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>–
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The raw material of
 <italic class="italic"> R. carthamoides</italic> comprises roots and rhizomes of three- to four-year-old plants which are used in various dietary supplements or nutraceutical preparations. The collection of raw material from natural habitat or cultivation is not effective because it requires the destruction of the whole plants [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. An alternative may be the biotechnological approaches such as the hairy root cultures obtained by
 <italic class="italic"> Agrobacterium rhizogenes</italic> transformation. Hairy root cultures are characterized by rapid increase of biomass in a short time (4–6 weeks) and genetic stability. The level of secondary metabolites in these cultures may be comparable to or higher than in roots of plants growing naturally [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. In our previous study we obtained hairy roots of
 <italic class="italic"> R. carthamoides</italic> and evaluated their phytochemical profile in methanol extract [
