<p>Carotenoids together with tocopherols are involved in the oxidative stability of the oil and have a protective role against cancer and cardiovascular diseases [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. More than 700 carotenoids have been identified in 89 plant foods and in the human body, but the overwhelming majority (ca. 90%) in the human diet is represented by 
 <italic>β</italic>-carotene, 
 <italic>α</italic>-carotene, lycopene, lutein, cryptoxanthin, and zeaxanthin [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The carotenoid content of
 <italic> L. kerstingii</italic> seed oil was 4.62 mg/kg of oil (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab5">Table 5</xref>). This value was similar to that reported for
 <italic> Capparis spinosa</italic> L. (4.57 mg/kg of oil) and lower than those of
 <italic> Phoenix canariensis</italic> seed oil (55.10 mg/kg of oil) and
 <italic> Rubus idaeus</italic> L. seed oil (230.00 mg/kg of oil) [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The forms of carotenoids found in
 <italic> L. kerstingii</italic> seed oil were lutein and 
 <italic>β</italic>-carotene. Lutein was the most abundant form, accounting for 80% of the total carotenoids.
