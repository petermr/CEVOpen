 <p id="Par1" class="p">The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the essential oil extracted from fresh leaves of 
  <italic class="italic">Pimenta racemosa</italic> in the improvement of fermented fish flour producing technology. Essential oil of 
  <italic class="italic">Pimenta racemosa</italic> was extracted by hydrodistillation and its chemical composition was determined by GC and GC/MS. Different types of fermented fish flours from Lesser African Threadfin (
  <italic class="italic">Galeoides decadactylus</italic>) were produced by the modification of the traditional processing technology and the introduction of a step of essential oil adjunction during the process. Three different essential oil concentrations (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 μL g
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) were investigated. Physicochemical, microbiological and nutritional analyzes were performed in order to evaluate the quality of the fermented fish flour produced. Results obtained revealed that the essential oil of 
  <italic class="italic">Pimenta racemosa</italic> investigated has a chemical composition characterized by the presence of myrcene (25.1%), chavicol (7.5%) and eugenol (51.1%). Fermented fish flour produced have a good nutritional potential. However, on the microbiological level, only samples produced by adjunction of essential oil have a low level of microbial contamination, with an absence of pathogenic microorganisms.
