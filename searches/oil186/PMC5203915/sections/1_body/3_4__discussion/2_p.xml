<p>The essential oil yield from
 <italic> R. carthamoides</italic> HR was higher than those from SGR, 0.09% and 0.06%, respectively. The oil yields were higher than those obtained previously from roots and rhizomes of
 <italic> R. carthamoides</italic> from the Czech Republic (0.04%) [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and similar to those from the roots and rhizomes of plants growing in Poland (0.07–0.11%) [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the present study, it was found that the essential oils from hairy roots and roots of soil-grown plants of
 <italic> R. carthamoides</italic> differed significantly in their compositions. Qualitative and quantitative differences have also been observed between essential oils compositions from hairy roots and parent plant roots for other plant species [
