<p>The toxic compounds of garlic essential oil induced mortality in larva, pupa and adult of 
 <italic>T. molitor</italic> within a short period of time. The LT
 <sub>50</sub> of 
 <italic>T. molitor</italic> larva applied with LC
 <sub>90</sub> diallyl disulfide and diallyl sulfide was approximately 20 and 36 h, pupae was 21 and 33 h, and adults was 27 and 40 h, respectively. Toxic compounds affect multiple regions of the insect body over a period of time, ranging from one to 20–40 h for death. In this period, the necrotic areas were increasing progressively on the insect body. The comparative effects on 
 <italic>T. molitor</italic> between garlic essential oil and toxic compounds were observed at various time points. An essential oil of quick action should be preferred for protection of products stored to be able to prevent feeding and avoid or reduce damage by insect pests
