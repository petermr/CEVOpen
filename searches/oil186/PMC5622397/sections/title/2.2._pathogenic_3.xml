 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pathogenicity of the fungus 
  <span class="italic">C. lunata</span> was verified through inoculation tests in maize plants. Initially, the seeds of the Traktor (Syngenta
  <span class="sup">®</span>) maize were sowed in seven polyethylene vases (3 L capacity) containing substrate, improved with 10 g of commercial fertilizer NPK (5-25-15) in each vase. There were made three holes, with two seeds added in each. The pruning was necessary when the plants reached two pairs of definitive leaves, which was in approximately 15 days, and then the inoculation could be initiated. There was utilized an entirely casualized design with seven treatments and three repetitions. There were different tested concentrations of conidia, being 10
  <span class="sup">1</span>, 10
  <span class="sup">2</span>, 10
  <span class="sup">3</span>, 10
  <span class="sup">4</span>, 10
  <span class="sup">5</span>, and 10
  <span class="sup">6</span> conidia mL
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, the concentrations were adjusted with the aid of a Neubauer chamber. The positive control prepared utilized only distilled water with the same volume utilized for the concentrations of the conidia. For the inoculation there was utilized a manual sprayer (500 mL capacity) containing suspension of conidia of 
  <span class="italic">C. lunata</span> derived from cultures incubated for 10 days in BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) at 25 °C. The suspensions were applied until the runoff point on the leaves (10 mL). Following this, the vases were kept for 48 h with humid cotton and closed with plastic bags aiming at providing the humid chamber. From 48 h after the inoculation, the vases were left in a shaded place until the appearance of the first leaf symptoms of the 
  <span class="italic">Curvularia</span> Leaf Spot. When the symptoms were visualized on the inoculated tissue, the fungus was re-isolated and cultivated in PDA environment. Afterwards, the fungus was inoculated again and re-isolated in the PDA environment, aiming at the compliance of all the stages of the Koch’s postulates.
