Introduction</div> <div class="backgroundtotheresearchproblem" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Background to the Research Problem</div> <p>Available statistics shows that Lesotho, which has an estimated adult HIV prevalence rate of 23%, has the third highest HIV prevalence worldwide (WHO, 2014). The use of medicinal herbs to treat <i>Human immunodeficiency virus</i> (HIV) and <i>Acquired immunodeficiency. syndrome</i> (AIDS) in developing countries, including Lesotho, remains a contentious issue due to their unknown safety profiles. Medicinal herbs are often preferred because they are affordable and are purported to have less side effects compared to pharmaceutical drugs (Rafieian-Kopaei, 2011). The HIV/AIDS burden and cultural norms in African countries have continued to promote the use of medicinal herbs as complementary and alternative medicines to clinical antiretroviral drugs (Puoane, Hughes, Uwimana, Johnson, &amp;amp; Folk, 2012).</p> <p>In the context of the African traditional religion, the worshiping of a Supreme Being connects Africans with their ancestors and is at the core of how they treat diseases (Dilger, Burchardt, &amp;amp; van Dijk, 2010). The African traditional religion surmises that HIV/AIDS partly results from punishment by the Supreme Being (Wasti, Randall, Simkhada, &amp;amp; van Teijlingen, 2011). The religion therefore encourages that herbalists, traditional healers and diviners be consulted as part of the treatment of disease conditions. Many Basotho in Lesotho who believe in the African traditional religion observe this cultural norm (African Technology Policy Studies, 2013).</p> <p>Hussain (2011) notes that medicinal herb dosages are often not evaluated in clinical trials. Resultantly, their dosages and safety are not known (Petzer &amp;amp; Mngqundaniso, 2008). In some cases, there are concerns about deliberate adulteration of herbs with clinical drugs by some herbalists and contamination by microbial organisms when herbs are prepared in unhygienic conditions (Hussain, 2011).</p> </div> <div class="theinteractionbetweenmedicinalherbsandconventionaldrugs" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
The Interaction between Medicinal Herbs and Conventional Drugs</div> <p>According to Hussain (2011), herb-drug interaction is the alteration of a therapeutic drug by a medicinal herb. Herb-drug interactions are either pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic in nature. Pharmacokinetic interaction is the effect of a medicinal herb on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of a therapeutic drug, while pharmacodynamic interactions are often attributed to pharmacological activity of herbs, which results in the potentiated or decreased action of drugs (Chen et al., 2012; Hussain, 2011). Enzyme induction and inhibition particularly in the intestines, liver and kidneys is thought to play an important role in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic herb-drug interactions (Chen et al., 2012).</p> <p>Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions may alter the concentration of a therapeutic drug in the blood. The most common interactions include the interaction with the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, the P-glycoprotein drug transporters and the organic anion transporters (Hussain, 2011). For example, <i>Allium sativum</i> (garlic) is known to pharmacokinetically reduce the serum concentration of protease inhibitors (PIs) such as saquinavir and indinavir (Langlois-Klassen, Kipp, Jhangri, &amp;amp; Rubaale, 2007; Nagata et al., 2011). <i>Hypericum perforatum</i> (St John’s wort) is also known to significantly reduce blood concentrations of several drugs, including amitriptyline, warfarin and indinavir (Chen et al., 2012).</p> </div> <div class="medicinalherbsbelievedtohaveantiviralpropertiesandtheireffects" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Medicinal Herbs Believed to Have Antiviral Properties and Their Effects</div> <p>According to Peltzer et al. (2011) and Langlois-Klassen et al. (2007), <i>Hypoxis hemerocallidea</i> (African potato), <i>Hypericum perforatum</i> (St. John’s wort), <i>Sutherlandia frutescens</i> (Sutherlandia) and <i>Allium sativum</i> (garlic) are some of the most commonly used herbs by HIV-positive people in sub- Saharan Africa.</p> <p>African potato is commonly used as an immune booster (Mills, Cooper, Seely, &amp;amp; Kanfer, 2005). The active ingredients in the African potato which are thought to have anti-HIV activity include phytosterols, hypoxide, aglycone and rooperol (Wink &amp;amp; Van Wyk, 2004). However, according to Müller and Kanfer (2011), African potato may interfere with antiretroviral drugs such as efavirenz through inhibition of cytochrome P450 and P-glycoprotein, which are important liver enzymes that metabolise and eliminate antiretroviral drugs.</p> <p><i>Hypericum perforatum</i> (St. John’s wort), is a small shrub which contains hyperforin, hypericin, pseudohypericin, flavonoids and oligomeric procyanidines (Nathan, 2001; Wink &amp;amp; Van Wyk, 2004). Petijová, Skyba, and Cellárová (2012), note that biologically active metabolites such as hypericins and phloroglucinols in this plant may have anti-cancer, antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. However, Hussain (2011) notes that St. John’s wort has potential toxic effects through substrate-mediated inhibition or inducement of cytochrome liver enzymes, including an intestinal and a hepatic cytochrome known as CYP3A4.</p> <p><i>Allium sativum</i> (Garlic) is a perennial herb which contains sulphur-containing biologically active compounds, including S-allyl-l-cysteine, diallyl disulfide, diallyl trisulfide, ajoene, and allicin, which gives it its antimicrobial, antioxidative, antiviral, anticancer and lipid lowering effects (Lee et al., 2012; Motsei, Lindsey, Van Staden, &amp;amp; Jäger, 2003).</p> <p><i>Sutherlandia frutescens</i> (Sutherlandia) is another perennial shrub believed to have anti-HIV activity. The herb contains triterpenoids glycosides, flavonoids, amino-acids, including L-canavine which is a non-protein amino-acid and pinitol, which is a cyclitol (Wink &amp;amp; Van Wyk, 2004). Canavine has been demonstrated to have the capacity to disturb protein biosynthesis, a property which is thought to contribute to its anticancer and antiviral activity (Wink &amp;amp; Van Wyk, 2004). Sutherlandia has been used to treat HIV symptoms and opportunistic infections, including tuberculosis, chronic fatigue, influenza, indigestion, peptic ulcers, and diarrhoea (Mills et al., 2005). However, like African potato, sutherlandia inhibits cytochrome P450 and P-glycoprotein, which implies that the herb may interfere with antiretroviral treatment (Müller &amp;amp; Kanfer, 2011).</p> <p>To improve antiretroviral treatment outcomes in Lesotho, more data on the medicinal herbs used by HIV-positive people and the reasons for their use is required. This study therefore explored some medicinal herbs used by HIV-positive people in Lesotho and the reasons for their use.</p> </div> </div> <div class="methods" title="methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Discussion</div> <p>About 69.9% of HIV-positive people in this population have used medicinal herbs concurrently with antiretroviral drugs at least once in their lives. Out of the 69.9%, 7.7% conceded that they frequently used medicinal herbs concurrently with antiretroviral treatment. It is important to note that some participants may not have disclosed their use of medicinal herbs. According to Petzer and Mngqundaniso (2008), up to 70% of people living with HIV do not disclose to the health professionals when they use complementary and alternative therapies. Therefore, this study highlights the level of popularity of medicinal herbs among HIV positive people in Lesotho.</p> <p>The study identified 20 plant species belonging to 16 families that were reportedly used by the participants. Asteraceae was the most common plant family used by the participants. However, the effects of most of these plants on antiretroviral drugs are not known.</p> <p>In terms of plant species, <i>Allium sativum</i> and <i>Dicoma anomala</i> were cited as the most common (21.0% and 14.3%, respectively) medicinal herbs used in this population. A study in Kenya which reported similar results found that more than 25% of HIV-positive people used <i>Allium sativum</i> (Nagata et al., 2011). The current study also concurs with Langlois-Klassen et al. (2007) who reported that <i>Allium sativum</i> is one of the most common medicinal herb used by HIV-positive people in sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p><i>Allium sativum</i> (Garlic) is known to pharmacokinetically reduce the serum concentration of protease inhibitors (PIs) such as saquinavir and indinavir (Langlois-Klassen et al., 2007; Nagata et al., 2011). <i>Dicoma anomala</i> has been reported as an inhibitor of cytochrome-P enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 (Müller &amp;amp; Kanfer, 2011). This implies that <i>Dicoma anomala</i> may interact with drugs that use these cytochrome-P enzymatic pathways.</p> <p>Roots were the most common parts of medicinal plants used by the participants in this study. Use of plant roots destroys plants and may result in some plants becoming extinct (Bhat, Kumar, &amp;amp; Bussmann, 2013). There is need to increase the awareness about the conservation of these plants, particularly among the people who are responsible for harvesting the plants. With respect to the reasons for use of medicinal herbs, 32% of the participants in this study cited boosting the immune system as the main reason for using medicinal herbs. It is possible that some traditional healers and dealers in the medicinal herbs may take advantage of the demand for the herbs and sell unsafe herbs to unsuspecting clients. Therefore, users of medicinal herbs in this population need to be made aware about toxicity of some of the plants and their interaction with antiretroviral drugs.</p> <p>It is important to note that most of the medicinal plants used by HIV-positive people in this study were found to be used to treat other conditions in the literature. However, in some cases, the uses cited by the participants did not concur with the literature. On one hand, this may indicate the diversity of uses of medicinal plants in different societies. On the other hand, it may imply that herbalists may be selling fraudulent medicinal herbs or wrongly prescribing them to unsuspecting clients.</p> <p>The efficacy and safety of most of the medicinal plants used by HIV-positive people was not known. This highlights the need to incorporate information on the possible dangers of using medicinal herbs whose safety is not known into the counselling protocols of HIV positive patients in Lesotho and other countries. Several limitations might have affected this study, including reluctance by some participants to disclose the medicinal herbs they used. The other limitation is that this study could not establish the effect of medicinal herbs on antiretroviral treatment outcomes. However, the plants identified in this study can be a useful resource to researchers who may want to study the effects of these medicinal herbs on antiretroviral treatment outcomes.</p> </div> <div class="conclusion" title="conclusion"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusion</div> <p>A considerable proportion (69.9%) of HIV-positive people use medicinal herbs in this population and 7.7% use them frequently. Of the 20 plant species belonging to 16 families reportedly used in this study, Asteraceae was the most common family. <i>Allium sativum</i> and <i>Dicoma anomala</i> were the most commonly used medicinal herbs in this population. Boosting the immune system and treating gastrointestinal ailments were the most commonly reported reasons for using medicinal herbs.</p> <p>HIV counselling protocols in Lesotho should emphasize the dangers of using medicinal herbs whose safety and compatibility with antiretroviral drugs is not known. The efficacy and toxicity profiles of the medicinal plants identified in this study need to be investigated. Furthermore, the effects of these plants on antiretroviral treatment outcomes including herb-drug interactions need to be explored.</p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="ack" title="ack"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
