<p>The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by broth microdilution method which deals with preparing two-fold dilutions of the antimicrobial agent (
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). A series of twofold dilutions were dispensed in 96-well microtitration plate (100 μL in each well). Then 10 μL of inoculum containing 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL bacteria were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, 20 μL of INT solution 0.5% (w/v) was added to the wells and the microplates were further incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. A well-defined pink color in the wells signified positive microbial growth. Finally, the lowest concentration of the formulation that prevented bacterial growth was recorded as the MIC value.
