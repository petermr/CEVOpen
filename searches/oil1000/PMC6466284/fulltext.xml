The latter is exacerbating the overexploitation of natural resources, thus increasing the environmental impact of animal farming, as well as the prices of raw materials. In this sense, insects have been indicated as one of the possible alternatives to solve this problem, thus research efforts to test the feasibility of a practical application to the poultry sector are required. Therefore, the present study tested different inclusion levels of a defatted black soldier fly larvae protein meal in the diets for laying quails as an alternative ingredient to the soybean meal and oil. Results of the present study showed that the insect meal can technically be applied to laying quails&#x02019; feed formulations, providing optimal performance and health status. Egg nutritional quality and sensory profile too did not worsen when quails were fed with the insect meal supplementation. Further research efforts should be performed to improve the healthiness of the lipid fraction of the tested insect larvae and, in turn, the lipid quality of the eggs obtained from insect-fed quails. </p></sec><sec><title>Abstract</title><p>Insects are promising candidates as alternative sustainable sources of protein for poultry species. The present research studied the effect of a dietary inclusion of a defatted black soldier fly (BSF) larvae meal as an alternative protein source in the diets of laying quails, on productive performance, egg physicochemical quality, fatty acid profile, sensory traits and storage stability. A total of 225 laying quails were divided into 3 dietary groups (5 replicates/each). A conventional soybean meal-based diet was formulated (Control group), and two other diets were formulated including either 10% (BSF10) or 15% (BSF15) defatted BSF larvae meal. Laying quails showed satisfactory productive performance throughout the trial.

Introduction</title><p>In the last years, insects have started being considered a part of the possible solution to directly alleviate food insecurity, but also to improve the sustainability of the livestock production. It has been demonstrated that if insects are farmed exploiting low value food processing by-products or high-impacting waste streams, their use in animal feeding can be environmentally more beneficial than traditional sources of proteins [<xref rid="B1-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Insects are a natural dietary source of nutrients for many animal species, including free-range poultry and wild birds [<xref rid="B2-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Despite this, insect-based feeds in the European Union are currently allowed only for aquaculture, whereas further research and thus legislative efforts to allow their utilization in poultry species is still required. One of the most promising and widely investigated insect species in this sense is the black soldier fly (<italic>Hermetia illucens</italic>). This <italic>Diptera</italic> can be reared on a wide range of decomposing organic waste that are not suitable for human nutrition, like by products from food processing and organic waste [<xref rid="B3-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In this way the black soldier fly (BSF) can reduce the potential environmental load of waste streams, converting them into high valuable proteins (41&#x02013;44% of the total dry matter), which could be used in feed formulations [<xref rid="B4-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The protein derived from this efficient insect is also rich in essential amino acids, and it showed an overall superior amino acid profile compared to soybean meal [<xref rid="B5-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent study found that despite its high methionine: cysteine ratio (61:39), a complete replacement of soybean meal with BSF larva meal in broiler diets provided satisfactory outcomes without the need to modulate the optimal methionine: cysteine ratio [<xref rid="B6-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. But BSF larvae are not only a source of protein; in fact, they have a high fat content (up to 35%), and they are rich in minerals, among which Ca (5&#x02013;8% dry matter -DM-) and P (0.6% to 1.5% DM) [<xref rid="B4-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Because of all these positive features, together with being an insect species suitable for mass production, different research studies have been performed to evaluate the potential of including BSF in poultry diets. BSF meal was found to be an excellent source of energy, digestible amino acids, for broilers chickens [<xref rid="B7-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], broiler quails [<xref rid="B2-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B8-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and Barbary partridge [<xref rid="B9-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], ensuring optimal health status and proving satisfactory growth performance and overall meat quality. Among widely consumed animal products, eggs are a low-cost source of high-quality protein, lipids, vitamins and minerals, thus being suitable for any kind of consumer [<xref rid="B10-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Because of this, their production is rapidly increasing, and it is expected to reach the 89 million ton by 2030 [<xref rid="B11-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For this reason, the BSF larvae have also started being studied as a possible alternative ingredient for laying hens. Recent research studied layers&#x02019; performance, intestinal morphometry, enzymatic and microbial activity, egg quality and sensory traits [<xref rid="B11-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and encouraging results were provided.</p><p>Despite this, the influence of BSF larvae meal in laying quails&#x02019; diets is not clear yet. Quail production has been increasing in the last years, thanks to a series of positive intrinsic characteristics of this avian species: It provides high quality meat and eggs with fast return on investment, thanks to the early sexual maturity, rapid growth, short generation interval, high laying rate and limited feed and space requirements per bird [<xref rid="B17-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. </p><p>Based on these premises, the present research aimed at providing a holistic overview of the potential application of defatted BSF larvae meal in the diet for laying quails. The effects of two different defatted BSF larvae meal inclusion levels (10% and 15% in the diet) on the productive performance of the animals and the physicochemical quality, sensory attributes and storage stability of the eggs, were evaluated. </p></sec><sec id="sec2-animals-09-00115"><title>2.

Differently, another study testing a defatted BSF larva meal (crude protein: 61.3%; crude fat: 4.61%) as a complete replacement of soybean meal in the diets for Lohmann Brown Classic laying hens, highlighted a reduction in feed intake which negatively affected final body weight, laying percentage and egg weight [<xref rid="B14-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The visual system is well developed in poultry species: It has been reported that they can discriminate feeds with different colorimetric characteristics, that they tend to prefer the feed whose color is similar to the diet fed after hatching, and that colored diets can determine a reduction in feed intake [<xref rid="B34-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Despite the biological bases of color preferences in Japanese quail not completely being understood yet, it is accepted that color vision is a predominant aspect in feed choice for them, and that color preferences can be modified by learning and selective breeding [<xref rid="B35-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The fact that the defatted BSF larvae meal used in the present trial did not determine a significant change in the final color of the feed, could explain why productive performance of laying quails were not affected, differently from what was observed in the above-mentioned study.

On the one hand this result could have been due to the higher maize content of the feed included with the BSF larva meal in both experiments. On the other hand, in the above-mentioned study the increase in yolk redness was justified by the total carotenoid content of the insect meal, which enhanced also the total carotenoid content of the egg yolk. Existing research showed that the BSF larvae can contain 2.00&#x02013;2.15 mg carotenoids/kg [<xref rid="B11-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B40-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], but the effect of a dietary supplementation of BSF larva meal in laying birds on the pigment content of the egg is limited to the above-mentioned study by Secci et al. [<xref rid="B11-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], thus highlighting that further efforts to elucidate this aspect are needed, as it could have important market implications. In fact, carotenoids are important pigments that provide attractive color to egg yolk, which is a desirable visual characteristic, and the use of natural sources instead of synthetic ones is certainly more and more appreciated by modern consumers [<xref rid="B41-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Furthermore, carotenoids are well known antioxidants thanks to their ability to quench singlet oxygen and trap peroxyl radicals, as well as playing a role in improving the health status of humans though preventing cardiovascular diseases, cancer and other chronic diseases [<xref rid="B42-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>The proximate composition of quail eggs of the present study was in line with existing data about this avian species [<xref rid="B43-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The observed difference in terms of protein content in BSF15 eggs compared to the Control ones was not attributable the protein content of the experimental diets as it was similar, being 194 and 195 g/kg in the two feeds, respectively. Therefore, to explain such finding it was hypothesized a lower protein availability, due to the chitin content of the diets which increased with the defatted BSF larvae meal inclusion level. Chitin, which is a polysaccharide constituting insect exoskeleton, is known to exert a negative effect on nutrient digestion, included the protein fraction which was observed also in the work by Cullere et al. [<xref rid="B2-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] on meat quails fed with 10 and 15% defatted BSF larvae meal. This observation, however, was in contrast with the results of Secci et al. [<xref rid="B11-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], as they observed no effect of a 100% dietary substitution of soybean meal with BSF larva meal in the diets for laying hens on the egg proximate composition.</p><p>Results of the present research contrast with the previous cited paper also regarding the ash content of the eggs: In the present study ash augmented with increasing the dietary inclusion level of BSF larva meal, whereas in the above-mentioned research ash content was unaffected by the dietary treatment. A hypothesis to explain the present finding was that the BSF larva meal could have provided a dietary mineral enrichment thanks to the high content in Ca, P, K and Mg [<xref rid="B40-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, Ca and P contents were similar in the three experimental diets and the overall ash content too. Therefore, the reason for such ash content increase remains to be understood. </p><p>The cholesterol content in eggs yolk is species-related: Limiting the comparison to table eggs, quail eggs contain 11.4% more cholesterol (on average 390 mg/100 g whole egg) than dark-shell hen eggs (350 mg/100 g whole egg) [<xref rid="B44-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Cholesterol values observed in the present experiment for quail eggs (on average 473 mg/100 g whole egg) were even higher, having 35% more cholesterol than the dark-shell hen eggs of the above-mentioned study. The cholesterol content is primarily regulated endogenously (de novo synthesis) and scarcely dependent on the dietary treatment [<xref rid="B45-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Results of the present study agreed with this, as the dietary cholesterol provided to laying quails due to the incorporation of BSF larva meal did not modify the egg cholesterol content. </p><p>However, previous research testing BSF larva meal as a feed ingredient in laying hens (100% substitution of soybean meal), observed a reduction of 11.7% in the cholesterol content of the yolk in hens receiving the experimental diet including the BSF, compared to a Control group fed on soybean meal [<xref rid="B11-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Dietary chitin showed to attract negatively charged bile acids and free fatty acids, determining a reduction in the serum cholesterol content, which is the mechanism that should also explain the cholesterol reduction in the yolk [<xref rid="B15-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The limited data available on this topic, together with the contrasting results, highlight the need for further research on this aspect.</p><p>The nutritional composition of the BSF larvae, including its lipid content, is known to be strongly affected by the rearing substrate [<xref rid="B46-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]; despite this, the FA profile of this insect species is intrinsically characterized by a greatest proportion of SFA, which can account for the 75% of total FA, with C12:0 (lauric), C14:0 (myristic) and C16:0 (palmitic) acids being the main contributors. Moreover, this insect species has a limited proportion of MUFA (&#x0003c;10% of total FA) and PUFA (&#x0003c;15% of total FA), with C18:1 <italic>n</italic>-9 (oleic) and C18:2 <italic>n</italic>-6 (linoleic) being the main FA for the two fractions, respectively [<xref rid="B47-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Results about the FA profile of the laying quails&#x02019; diets further confirm this speculation. However, compared to the linear effect exerted by the FA composition of the defatted BSF larvae meal on the FA profile of quail and chicken meat [<xref rid="B8-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B46-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], the FA profile of the eggs revealed that, even if the FA composition of the diets had a great impact, which confirms existing knowledge on this aspect [<xref rid="B48-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], different mechanisms than the sole effect of the diet played a role.</p><p>To a great increase in the C12:0 content of the diets due to the inclusion of defatted BSF larva meal (+134%), the increase in the eggs did not show the same magnitude (+8%). On the other hand, to the relatively small dietary contents of palmitic acid (12.3% of total FA) and C18:0 (stearic acid; 5.67% of total FA), it was observed a double and more than 4-fold contents of C16:0 and C18:0 in the yolk, respectively. Results of the present research, in this sense, agreed with those by Secci et al. [<xref rid="B11-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] on laying hens. Defatted BSF larva meal provided relevant amounts of C12:0, C14:0 and C16:0 SFA which were effectively desaturated and elongated by laying quails to C14:1 <italic>n</italic>-9 (myristoleic), C17:1 <italic>n</italic>-10 (Cis-10-Heptadecenoic), C16:1 <italic>n</italic>-9 (palmitoleic), C18:1 <italic>n</italic>-9 and C18:1 <italic>n</italic>-11 (vaccenic) acids, thus explaining the increasing trend in the MUFA content from Control to the BSF15 group.</p><p>The dietary content of linoleic acid and C18:3 <italic>n</italic>-3 (&#x003b1;-linolenic) acid in poultry diets is very important as they are essential precursors of longer <italic>n</italic>-6 and <italic>n</italic>-3 PUFA, though synthesis catalyzed by enzyme complexes, including &#x00394;5 and &#x00394;6-desaturases and elongases [<xref rid="B49-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This was highlighted by the results of our study where laying quails produced eggs containing C20:4 <italic>n</italic>-6 (arachidonic), C20:5 <italic>n</italic>-3 (eicosapentaenoic; EPA) and C22:6 <italic>n</italic>-3 (docosaesaenoic; DHA) acids, even if diets had extremely low or no contents of such FA. In this sense, the capability of quails to enrich arachidonic acid and DHA contents in the egg yolk is documented [<xref rid="B50-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. As expected, the lower content of the essential precursors in the diet with increasing inclusion levels of defatted BSF larvae meal were the reason behind the lower content of the precursors themselves, but also of their derivatives, in the egg yolk.</p><p>Results of the present study agreed with other research where the dietary inclusion of feed ingredients with distinctive FA profile such as the hemp seed [<xref rid="B51-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], flaxseed and stearidonic acid-enriched (C18:4 <italic>n</italic>-3) soybean oils [<xref rid="B47-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], modified the FA composition of chickens&#x02019; egg yolk. The necessity to improve the FA profile of the larvae through substrate modulation in order to guarantee meat of satisfactory healthiness, was pointed out by previous papers on quails [<xref rid="B8-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and chickens [<xref rid="B32-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B47-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], where an increase in the saturation degree of lipids was observed to the expenses of the unsaturated fractions. Differently, the intense change in the FA composition (% of total FAME) of quail eggs due to the dietary inclusion of defatted BSF larva meal, and the consequent changes also in FA contents (mg/100 g egg) were in contrast with the only other work testing the BSF larva meal as feed ingredient for layers diets [<xref rid="B11-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], where the FA profile of chicken eggs was slightly affected by the dietary treatment. Such finding highlights thus the necessity of further research investigations to clarify the effect of this emerging feed ingredient on the FA profile of eggs in different poultry species. A dietary improvement of the FA composition of the diet seems however a desirable aspect to take into consideration in order to ensure heathy eggs for consumers.</p><p>The pH values recorded during the storage trial on quails&#x02019; eggs were slightly lower than values presented by Silva et al. [<xref rid="B18-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This finding was not surprising as albumen pH gives a clear indication of the freshness of the egg and, in the present experiment, pH measurement was conducted the day after the eggs were laid. The observed increase in the albumen pH after 28 days of storage, which was independent to the dietary treatment, is the natural consequence of the loss of carbon dioxide during storage, and the breaking down of the ovomucin-lysozyme complex [<xref rid="B52-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Literature data show that the supplementation of antioxidants-rich herbs or extracts from herbs during the laying period reduce eggs susceptibility to oxidative phenomena, thus offering the potential to increase the oxidative stability of poultry products [<xref rid="B52-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The effect of a dietary supplementation with insect meal on the oxidative stability of the eggs has not been investigated yet, thus results of the present research are the first ones in this sense. Results of the present research agreed with those of Yesilbag et al. [<xref rid="B53-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] where, despite the first day of storage MDA values didn&#x02019;t differ among treatments, a dietary inclusion with rosemary and oregano oils lowered the MDA content of the quail eggs&#x02019; yolk during the refrigerated storage. Our finding in this sense could depend on two different aspects: As it was pointed out by other studies [<xref rid="B8-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B40-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], the BSF larva contain carotenoids which are known for their antioxidant activity, which was however not assessed in the present study. On another hand, the defatted BSF larva meal is a source of SFA which determined a progressive lowering in the FA peroxidability index compared to the Control group, thus lowering the susceptibility to oxidative phenomena. Despite this, the observed lower MDA content in the BSF10 yolk, but not those of the BSF15 group compared to the Control yolks, was not expected and requires further investigation.</p><p>The sensory profile of eggs is surely a relevant aspect that must be considered when testing a novel feed ingredient in layers&#x02019; diets, as it demonstrated to be either negatively, positively or neutrally affected: Previous researches showed that the inclusion of fish silage [<xref rid="B54-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and flaxseed [<xref rid="B55-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] in laying hens&#x02019; diets negatively affected some sensory traits of the eggs. Also, when turmeric was fed to laying quails some negative effects on yolk appearance were observed, but aroma and flavor were overall acceptable [<xref rid="B18-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In literature the only other research study testing the effect of a dietary inclusion of defatted BSF larvae meal in layers&#x02019; diets on the sensory profile of the derived eggs, observed an improvement the appearance, texture, and taste of eggs derived from insects-fed birds (5% dietary inclusion), positively affecting the overall product acceptability [<xref rid="B12-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Sensory improvements were attributable to the high glutamic acid content of the insect meal. The present defatted BSF larva meal was previously also tested in the diets for broiler quails at the same inclusion levels of the present study [<xref rid="B8-animals-09-00115" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but no differences in the sensory profile of the meat were observed. Analogously, in the present study the sensory traits of eggs derived from defatted BSF larva meal-fed quails were comparable with those obtained for quails fed the conventional diet. The latter result is extremely important in the perspective of a successful practical application of this new feed ingredient into dietary formulations for laying quails. </p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-animals-09-00115"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Based on the results of the present experiment, the defatted black soldier fly larvae meal can be considered a possible alternative ingredient to soybean meal in laying quail diets, up to the 15% inclusion level. No negative effects on the productive performance of birds were observed and eggs showed overall satisfactory physicochemical traits and sensory profile. Future studies should deeply investigate the impact of this feed ingredient on eggs&#x02019; fatty acid profile as contrasting results are currently available on this aspect. Furthermore, an improvement in the fatty acid composition of the larvae or a dietary incorporation of a PUFA-rich ingredient, together with the insect seems desirable to ensure healthy food products in line with modern consumers&#x02019; exigencies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful to Sandro Tenti, Giulia Tasoniero and Lotte Decraene for their technical support.
