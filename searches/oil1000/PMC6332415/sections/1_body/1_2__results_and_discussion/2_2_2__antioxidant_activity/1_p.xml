<p class="p">Four antioxidant assays have been used to evaluate the possible antioxidant properties of the spearmint essential oil, including DPPH radical scavenging activity, superoxide anion scavenging, reducing power, and antioxidant assay using β-carotene linoleate system. The results obtained (
