  <title>Results:</title>
  <p>The 50% of cytotoxic concentrations was 26.4 μg/ml and 4266.7 μg/ml for Hela cells and human lymphocytes, respectively. The oil cytotoxicity against the human tumor cell line was far higher than the amount required for human healthy cells. Conversely, the essential oil’s IC
   <sub>50</sub> value of 49.2 μg/ml in the DPPH assay, could be regarded as its strong antioxidant potential.
