<p class="p">Wistar rats weighing 250–380 g were slightly anesthetized with ether. Abdominal aorta was catheterized and blood was collected in anti-coagulated tubes with a mixture of acid citric (130 mM)-trisodium citrate (170 mM)-glucose 4% (9:1, v/v). Washed platelets were prepared according to the experimental design reported by Gadi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>]. A first centrifugation of blood (230 x g/15 min) was made and permitted to obtain a platelet rich plasma (PRP), which was centrifuged a second time (400 x g/ 15 min) to obtain the platelet pellet. The platelets were then washed once with washing buffer (NaCl 137 mM, KCl 2.6 mM, NaHCO
