<p id="Par11" class="p">An Agilent HP-6890 gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) with a HP-5 5% phenylmethylsiloxane capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness) and an FID detector was used for GC–FID analysis. Helium gas (1 mL/min) was used as the carrier gas. Injector and mass transfer line temperatures were set at 250 and 280 °C, respectively. The EO solution (1 μL) in hexane was injected and analysed under the following column conditions: initial column temperature of 40 °C for 1 min, increased to 250 °C at a 3 °C/min, and maintained at 250 °C for 20 min.</p>
