<p>The formulations stored at 5°C presented a better stability when compared to the formulations stored at room temperature [
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>].[
 <xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] There was an increase of IC with increasing storage time in the formulations. However, the emulsions F1, F2, F3, F4, and F5 showed the least CI, and the formulation F2 had the lowest CI, proving to be the most stable at the temperature 5ºC [
