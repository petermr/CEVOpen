<p class="p">To assess the cytotoxic effects, the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line was used in this study. Cells were seeded into 96 and 24-well plates in 1:1 mixture of DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, antibiotic and antimycotic solution in a humid atmosphere of 5% CO

The media was changed on alternative days and once the confluency was reached, the cells were treated with sample at different concentrations. The MTT assay and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay was performed to determine the cell viability as described in a previous report

After treatments, MTT (0.5 mg/mL) was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and the formed formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO, and then the percentage of cell viability was calculated. For LDH release assay, the SH-SY5Y cells were plated at a density of 5 × 10

The cells were precipitated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (100 μL) was mixed with 900 μL of kit reaction mixture and the enzyme activity was measured in terms of intracellular LDH released into the medium at a wavelength of 340 nm.
