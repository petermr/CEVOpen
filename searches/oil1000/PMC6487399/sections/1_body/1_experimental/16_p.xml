<p class="p">Anti-acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and anti-butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE; Sigma Aldrich) activities of the essential oil were conducted using the Ellman method with slight modification (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>). The essential oil was dissolved in methanol: DMSO (1:1 v/v). Then, serial dilutions of the essential oil were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 100 mM, pH 8.0). In the next step, 25 µL of different dilutions of the oil were added to the mixture of 25 µL of AChE (Sigma Aldrich) or BChE (Sigma Aldrich) solution (0.22 U/mL) and 50 µL PBS. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min, after which 125 µL of DTNB and acetylthiocholine iodide and butyrylthiocholine iodide as substrates were added. Using a microplate reader (ELX808, BioTek, USA) the absorbance was measured at 412 nm after 15 min. A tube containing all reagents except the test compound was used as a negative control (blank). Tacrine was applied as a positive control. All experiments were conducted in triplicate. The inhibitory effect of a sample was calculated as follows:
