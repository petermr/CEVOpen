    "The effect of boiling and roasting on the lipid quality, proximate composition, and mineral content of African walnut seeds (Tetracarpidium conophorum) was assessed. Results indicated that the quality of walnut oil significantly (p < .05) reduces with the treatments. Oils extracted from DBWN 60 min (Dried and boiled walnuts 60 min) and FBWN 60 min (Boiled fresh walnuts 60 min) were the most altered. The proximate composition and mineral content of walnut seeds was also significantly affected (p < .05) by the treatments. This study reveals that, thermal processing has significant effects on the nutrients and quality of lipids of walnut oil. DTRWN 60 min (Dried and traditionally roasted walnuts 60 min), DORWN 60 min (Dried and oven roasted walnuts 60 min), and TRFWN 30 min (traditionally roasted fresh nuts 30 min) are the best methods for cooking walnut because they preserve the quality of its lipids and some of the nutrients."
