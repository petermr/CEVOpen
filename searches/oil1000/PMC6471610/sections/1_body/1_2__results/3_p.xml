<p class="p">Analyzing the influence of ethanol concentrations on the extraction of compounds, it was found that most of the different compounds were extracted using 70% ethanol (fifteen compounds), or at least 50% ethanol (eight compounds). The higher the ethanol concentration, the better the extracts were extracted, for example with
