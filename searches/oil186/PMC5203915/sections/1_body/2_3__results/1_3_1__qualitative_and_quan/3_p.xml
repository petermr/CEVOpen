<p class="p">Sesquiterpenes, especially sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (54.7–62.2%), dominated in both essential oils (

 <italic class="italic">all</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">cis</italic>-heptadeca-1,8,11,14-tetraene) was the main constituent (27.3%). Among the sesquiterpenes, nardosina-1(10),11-diene was identified as the most dominant compound (20.7%) in this essential oil according to its mass spectrum and retention index [

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. In addition, petasitene (4.3%) and
