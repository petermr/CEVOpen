<p class="p">The concentration of elements is not uniformly distributed throughout the plant. In general, the roots contain the highest level of elements followed by stems, leaves, flowers, buds and fruits of the different maturity stages. Nevertheless, uptake of elements by a plant is influenced by various factors, including the type of plant, nature of the soil, climate and agricultural practices [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. In the current study, the different elemental concentrations were varied due to the above factors. 
 <italic class="italic">A. sowa</italic> L. root accumulated a significant amount of minerals in Bangladeshi geo-environmental condition. The results are also compared with the reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>] data of 
 <italic class="italic">Anethum graveolens</italic> L. root where K (38,500 ppm) had the highest value, Ca (12,200 ppm) and Mg (6700 ppm) had the lowest values than our current study. The elements, especially Ca, Mg, K, Na, Fe and Al play a significant role in human metabolism and the life processes. The rich amount of Ca is important because of its role in bones, teeth, muscle system and heart functions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. Mg has been particularly shown to play a significant role as a regulatory cation in direct and indirect traumatic brain injury [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]. Another report on Mg, it also helps in preventing some heart disorders and high blood pressure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>]. Recently, it has been reported that trace amounts of Rb and Cs help in the breakdown of starch to glucose [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. Cs was present in the trace amount (21.53 ppb) in the present study. Se has anti-oxidising function and it is essential for providing the organism with triiodothyroxine produced from thyroxine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. It contributes to the maintenance of cellular antioxidative balance when taken up at the recommended dietary allowance of 50–100 μg/day and tolerable upper intake limit is 400 μg/day [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>]. The high dosage of selenate has been shown to normalize hyperglycemia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. Li is another element with beneficial pharmacological properties which effectively used in the treatment of manic depressive disorders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. The result also showed that many of these elements have vital importance in human metabolism for growth, developments and also prevention and healing of diseases. The non-essential or toxic elemental contents in spice and medicinal plants are attracting attention to the scientist and also the food chemist due to its adverse effect on the human body in respect of medicinal and food preparation. The permissible limits of Hg and As are 1 and 10 mg/kg in foodstuff respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>]. The maximum prescribed limit of Cd is 0.3 mg/kg for herbal medicines and its product while the dietary intake limit is 10.3 mg/kg as per who recommendation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. Moreover, the toxic elements were found below the prescribed limits in the present experiment. Nonetheless, excessive intake can cause poisoning in the human body. Hg poisoning can result in damage to the brain, kidney, lungs including acrodynia (pink disease), Hunter-Russell syndrome and Minamata disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. The acute sign of As poisoning includes fever, anorexia, hepatomegaly, cardiac arrhythmia, transient encephalopathy and irritation of the gastrointestinal tract [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]. Cd intoxication can lead to kidney, bone and pulmonary damages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. Pb and Cd cause both acute and chronic poisoning, adverse effects on the kidney, liver, heart, vascular and immune system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>]. Furthermore, root parts of 
 <italic class="italic">Anethum sowa</italic> L. herb is not usually consumed, it is wasted mostly. The present investigation will be helpful for Ayurvedic and pharmaceutical industries to assess the essential and toxic elemental level for medicinal preparation.
