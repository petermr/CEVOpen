    "The purpose of this research was to investigate the chemical profile, nutritional quality, antioxidant and hypolipidemic effects of Mexican chia seed oil (CSO) in vitro. Chemical characterization of CSO indicated the content of α-linolenic acid (63.64% of total fatty acids) to be the highest, followed by linoleic acid (19.84%), and saturated fatty acid (less than 11%). Trilinolenin content (53.44% of total triacylglycerols (TAGs)) was found to be the highest among seven TAGs in CSO. The antioxidant capacity of CSO, evaluated with ABTS•+ and DPPH• methods, showed mild antioxidant capacity when compared with Tocopherol and Catechin. In addition, CSO was found to lower triglyceride (TG) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels by 25.8% and 72.9%respectively in a HepG2 lipid accumulation model. As CSO exhibits these chemical and biological characteristics, it is a potential resource of essential fatty acids for human use."
