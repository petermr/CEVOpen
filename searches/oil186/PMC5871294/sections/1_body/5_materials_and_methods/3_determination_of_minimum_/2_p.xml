<p class="p">In addition, media from wells with fungi showing no visible growth were further cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and from wells with bacteria showing no visible growth on Muller-Hinton agar (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) to determine the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), respectively. MFCs and MBCs were determined as the lowest concentration yielding no more than 4 colonies, which corresponds to a mortality of 98% of the microorganisms in the initial inoculums.</p>
