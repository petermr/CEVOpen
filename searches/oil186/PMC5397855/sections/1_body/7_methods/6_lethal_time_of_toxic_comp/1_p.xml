<p>Toxicity of garlic essential oil and commercially obtained diallyl sulfide and diallyl disulfide at the calculated LC
 <sub>50</sub> and LC
 <sub>90</sub> concentrations were compared. Distilled water was used as a control. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> and LC
 <sub>90</sub> of each compound were applied in larvae, pupae, and adults of 
 <italic>T. molitor</italic>. Insects were individualized in Petri dishes with wheat bran and sugarcane. A total of 240 larvae, 240 pupae, and 240 adults were used for each treatment, with a total of four replicates. Mortality was recorded every 6 h for 48 h, and estimated lethal time values for 50% mortality (LT
 <sub>50</sub>) were compared.
