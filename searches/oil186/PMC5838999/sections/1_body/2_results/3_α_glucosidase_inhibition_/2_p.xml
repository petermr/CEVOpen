<p id="Par53">To investigate the type of enzyme inhibition and to determine the inhibition constant (Ki), the kinetics was performed according to the procedure detailed in the Materials and Methods section. The Lineweaver–Burk plots analysis indicated that the lines coincided on a point on the left side of the 
 <italic>Y</italic>-axis and intercepted both the 
 <italic>Y</italic>- and the 
 <italic>X</italic>-axes at different points. What can be also observed are a decrease in apparent V
 <sub>max</sub> value and an increase in the value of apparent K
 <sub>m</sub>, indicating that the nature of inhibition is of mixed-type (Fig.
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).
