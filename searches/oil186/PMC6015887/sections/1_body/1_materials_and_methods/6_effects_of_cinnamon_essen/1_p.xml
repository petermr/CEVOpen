<p class="p">The effects of CEO on intracellular leakage were determined using a extracellular conductivity method with minor modifications (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tao et al., 2014</xref>). Initially, the mycelia disks (Ø = 5 mm) were placed upside down on the center of Petri dishes with 20 mL of PDA and incubated in the dark at 25°C until the growth reached the edge of the plates. Then, the sterile filter paper was added with the MFC of CEO, and PDA plates without CEO were served as negative controls. Mycelia were collected after incubation for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days in the dark at 25°C, and washed with 15 mL of SDW. The supernatants were collected after centrifugation. The extracellular conductivity at each time point was carried out using a DDS-11A conductivity meter (Shanghai Precision Scientific Instrument Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China) and expressed as μS/cm. Each treatment was replicated thrice and the experiment was repeated thrice.
