<p class="p">The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of HEO were determined by the broth microdilution method, according to CLSI (2009). MBCs were determined by seeding 20 mL from all clear MIC wells onto Mueller–Hinton agar (MHA, Oxoid) plates. The MBC was defined as the lowest extract concentration which killed 99.9% of the final inocula after 24 h incubation at 37 °C.</p>
