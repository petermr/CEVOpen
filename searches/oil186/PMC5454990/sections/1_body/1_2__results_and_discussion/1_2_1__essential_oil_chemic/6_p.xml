<p>The oils of 
 <italic>O. caniculata</italic> showed predominance of sesquiterpenes of selinane and caryophyllane skeletons. In the leaves (
 <bold>Can-L</bold>), the main compounds were β-selinene (20.3%), β-caryophyllene (18.9%), 7-
 <italic>epi</italic>-α-selinene (14.3%), and bicyclogermacrene (10.4%); in the branches (
 <bold>Can-B</bold>), selin-11-en-4-α-ol (20.6%), β-selinene (12.1%), 7-
 <italic>epi</italic>-α-selinene (9.0%), β-caryophyllene (7.1%), and the phenylpropanoid (
 <italic>E</italic>)-asarone (8.8%) were identified. Interestingly, the leaf essential oil of 
 <italic>O. foetens</italic>, an endemic species of the Macronesian region (Canary Islands, Spain, and Madeira Islands, Portugal), had very little concentration of monoterpenoids or sesquiterpenoids, but was rich in ethyl 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumarate [
