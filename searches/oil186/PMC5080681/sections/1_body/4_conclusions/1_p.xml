<p>Our study showed that the essential oil extracted from 
 <italic>T. bovei</italic> was comprised of a mixture of several volatile bioactive components, especially the oxygenated monoterpenoids, which showed strong anthelmintic, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. This natural essential oil can be used for manufacturing of food supplements, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals formulations due to its potential biological and pharmacological activities. However, further investigation should be carried out on the 
 <italic>T. bovei</italic> activities against other pathogens as well as cancer, and more studies are required to investigate its anthelmintic activity.
