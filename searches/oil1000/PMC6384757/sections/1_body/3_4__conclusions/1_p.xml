 <italic class="italic">A. argyi</italic> essential oil has aroused attention due to its biological activities. In this study, three methods were applied to extract the essential oil from 
 <italic class="italic">A. argyi</italic> leaves. The effects of each method on the yields, chemical composition and bioactivity were investigated. The yield of SDE extract was nearly 1.2%, which was comparable to the subcritical extract (1%), while much higher than the hydrodstilled oil (0.5%). Although the chemical compounds of the SDE oil was much less than hydrodistilled oil and subcritical extract oil, the major compounds including caryophyllene oxide, neointermedeol, borneol, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-thujone and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene of SDE oil accounted for 82.93%, which was higher than subcritical extraction and hydrodistillation. The antimicrobial activities of these oils were estimated using agar disc diffusion and MIC assays. They showed that SDE oil had a good antimicrobial activity, and the activity against tested microorganisms like 
 <italic class="italic">L. monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. vulgaris</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. enteritidis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">A. niger</italic> was higher or equal to those of other two extracts. Furthermore, SEM results showed that 
 <italic class="italic">A. argyi</italic> essential oil could destroy the structure of cell walls and the SDE oil had the strongest inhibitory effect against the tested strains. All these results above suggested that SDE 
 <italic class="italic">A. argyi</italic> essential oil had the advantages in yield, bioactive ingredients and antimicrobial activities, which qualified that SDE oil could be a good preservative candidate for the food industry.
