<p>In summary, results from the present study indicated that the essential oil from 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> rhizomes possessed an excellent antioxidant activity, as evidenced by 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays. The essential oil exhibited the protective effect against DNA oxidative damage induced by Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> and AAPH, respectively. Moreover the essential oil also showed cytotoxic effects on the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line and antibacterial activity against several foodborne pathogens. This study may provide biological evidence for the practical application of the 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> rhizomes essential oil in food and pharmaceutical industries. However, further investigation of its activity 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, is necessary to elaborate and exploit this promise. Moreover, further studies should also include the molecular mechanism of the biological activity of the essential oil from 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> rhizomes.
