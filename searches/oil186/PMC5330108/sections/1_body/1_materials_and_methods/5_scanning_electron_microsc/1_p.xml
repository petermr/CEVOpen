<p>The 24 h old fungal culture on PDB treated with MPE at varied concentrations of control, MIC and MFC were used for scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation. The 
 <italic>F. sporotrichioides</italic> cells were fixed in glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PBS for 30 min, washed with 0.1 M PBS, and dehydrated by immersing in ice-cold ethanol for 10 min. The dehydrated samples were smeared on silver stub like a thin film and were coated by cathodic spraying (Polaron gold). The SEM observations were made using a ZEISS Instrument (EHT = 15.00 kV, signal A = VPSE G3).
