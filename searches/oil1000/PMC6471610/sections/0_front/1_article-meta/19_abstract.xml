  <italic class="italic">Myristica fragrans</italic> (f. Myristicaceae) seeds are better known as a spice, but their chemical compounds may have a pharmacological effect. The yield of their composition of extracts and essential oils differs due to different methodologies. The aim of this study was to evaluate an excipient material—magnesium aluminometasilicate—and to determine its influence on the qualitative composition of nutmeg extracts and essential oils. Furthermore, we wanted to compare the yield of essential oil. The extracts were prepared by maceration (M) and ultrasound bath-assisted extraction (UAE), and the essential oil—by hydrodistillation (HD). Conventional methods (UAE, HD) were modified with magnesium aluminometasilicate. The samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. From 16 to 19 chemical compounds were obtained using UAE with magnesium aluminometasilicate, while only 8 to 13 compounds were obtained using UAE without an excipient. Using our conditions and plant material, for the first time eight new chemical compounds in nutmeg essential oil were identified. Two of these compounds (γ-amorphene and cis-α-bergamotene) were obtained with the use of excipient, the other six (β-copaene, bergamotene, citronellyl decanoate, cubebol, cubenene, orthodene) by conventional hydrodistillation. Magnesium aluminometasilicate significantly increased the quantity of sabinene (from 6.53% to 61.42%) and limonene (from 0% to 5.62%) in essential oil. The yield of the essential oil from nutmeg seeds was significantly higher using magnesium aluminometasilicate; it increased from 5.25 ± 0.04% to 10.43 ± 0.09%.
