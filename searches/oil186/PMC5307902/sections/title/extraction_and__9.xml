 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fresh leaves of 
  <span class="italic">P. amboinicus</span> were extracted by steam distillation using the Linax extractor (model D2 Mini, São Paulo, Brazil). The leaves were transferred to the reservoir, which features a continuous water cycle coming directly from the water system. This water was not in contact with the sample, the water vapor was passed through the reservoir, which contains the leaves, and drags down the volatile constituents. The samples were stored in glass vials under refrigeration to prevent possible losses of volatile constituents. Different extraction times [1 to 6 h] were used to optimize the estimate of the best yield.
