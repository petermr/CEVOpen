<p>There are various conventional methods to extract oil from oilseeds such as extraction with solvents through various extractors or extraction by mechanical approach such as pressing. Generally, oil extraction with pressing is a simple, safe and economical technology; therefore the advantages of this method makes it more efficient compared to solvent application approach. The mechanical method is used for oilseeds with high oil content. Applying this method solely is not sufficient and high amounts of oil remain in the meal which should be extracted by solvents. Oil extraction by pressing is done in hot or cold conditions. The yield of oil extracted in hot pressing is higher than cold pressing but because of elevated temperatures during hot pressing, the quality of the obtained oil is low while the oil obtained through cold pressing maintains its natural properties with limited chemical reactions. For this reason, the demand for oils obtained from cold pressing increased (Singer, Nogala‐Kalucka, &amp; Lampart‐Szczap,
