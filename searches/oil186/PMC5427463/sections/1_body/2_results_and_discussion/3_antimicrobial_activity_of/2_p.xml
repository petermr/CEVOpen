<p>Concerning the Gram-negative bacteria, the sample was slightly active against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. enteretidis</italic> and 
 <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> which showed the lowest values of MIC (2.5 mg/ mL). Our results are similar to those previously reported in the literature, indicating that Gram-positive bacteria are more sensitive to essential oils than Gram-negative bacteria (Mangena and Muyima, 1999[
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). The microorganisms tested in this study cover some human pathogens known as opportunists for man and animals and cause food contamination and deterioration. Our results are of a great importance, particularly in the case of 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. enteretidis</italic> which are well known for their resistance to a number of phytochemical compounds and for the production of several types of enterotoxins that cause gastroenteritis (Halpin-Dohnalek and Marth, 1989[

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T4">(Tab. 4)</xref>, the SoEO exhibited varying degrees of antifungal activity against all tested strains. The inhibition zones were in the range of 09 - 15 mm, with MIC values of 0.156 - 5 mg/mL. The most sensitive one was 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> (MIC = 0.156 mg/mL), but the SoEO showed also a very good activity against 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> and 
 <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> (MIC = 0.625 mg/ mL for both). Interestingly, we have demonstrated the capacity of the SoEO to control some fungal strains, particularly fungi (
 <italic>A. niger</italic>, 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic>) responsible for biodeterioration of food during postharvest processing, transport and storage and agricultural phytopathogenic fungi.
