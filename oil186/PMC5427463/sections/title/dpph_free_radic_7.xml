 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ability of SoEO to scavenge the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical was measured using the method described by Sahin et al. (2004[
  <a rid="R45" ref-type="bibr" href="#R45">45</a>]) with modifications. 0.5 mL of different concentrations of SoEO prepared in methanol (1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg/mL) was added to 1.5 mL of a methanolic DPPH solution (100 µM). The measurement of absorbance was made against a blank prepared for each concentration at 517 nm after 30 min of incubation in the dark at room temperature. The positive control is represented by a solution of a standard antioxidant (BHT). Its absorbance was measured under the same conditions as the samples. Absorbance values of these solutions were recorded on an ultraviolet and visible (UV-VIS) spectrometer (Lambda 25, PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The results were expressed as percent inhibition (I %) using the following Eq

  <sub>test </sub>is the absorbance value of the essential oil sample, Abs

  <sub>50</sub> values were determined graphically by linear regression. All measurements were performed in triplicate and repeated twice.
