 <p> ROS production in LPS-stimulated astrocytes. Astrocytes were induced with LPS (1  μg/mL) and then incubated for 24 h with 100  μg/mL of Rhaponticum carthamoides HR and SGR essential oils. Values are given as means ± SD of three independent experiments. ∗ p &lt; 0.05 versus control; # p &lt; 0.05 HR essential oil versus SGR essential oil. </p>
