<p class="p">Traditional methods such as maceration, percolation, infusion, decoction, and Soxhlet method are commonly used to produce extracts [

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-01062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. These methods are cheap but less efficient, which wastes a lot of time and raw materials [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-01062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. One of the more recent methods for extracts is extraction in an ultrasound-assisted bath, it is an effective method, in which it is possible to choose the desired conditions (i.e., temperature, duration), and it saves on materials and time [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-01062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) has many modifications with solvents, and extra material can be used for extraction; for example: surfactants [

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-01062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], and other excipients, which can increase the efficiency of extraction.
