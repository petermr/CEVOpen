<p>This study is aimed to produce and evaluate nonionic O/W emulsions based on the essential oil from leaves of 
 <italic>Plectranthus amboinicus</italic>. For this proposal the physicochemical and phytochemical characterizations of the essential oil were performed. To produce stable O/W emulsions, the HLB system was used to determine the HLB of the essential oil.
