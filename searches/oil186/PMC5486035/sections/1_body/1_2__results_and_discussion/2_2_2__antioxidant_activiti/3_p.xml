<p>These activities are predominantly attributable to the high amount of monoterpenes hydrocarbons found in HEO. In fact, it has widely been demonstrated that monoterpene hydrocarbons are better antioxidant compounds in respect to sesquiterpenes and particularly those with strongly activated methylene groups in their structure, such as 4-Carene, α-Terpinene, and γ-Terpinene, were the most active. So, in agreement with the data reported in literature [
 <xref rid="B31-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], among oxygenated monoterpenes, the following order of effectiveness in antioxidant assays can be also hypothesised in our work: monoterpene phenols &gt; allylic alcohols &gt; monoterpenes aldehydes and ketones.
