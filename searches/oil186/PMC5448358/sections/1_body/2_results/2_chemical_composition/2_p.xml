<p>The essential oil of the aerial part (stems, leaves, and flowering tops) obtained with the samples collected from the Loufoulakari site is mainly rich in oxygenated monoterpenes whose contents range between 50.81% and 71.59%, with the following major compounds the isomers of 
 <italic>p</italic>‐menthadienol: 
 <italic>trans‐p</italic>‐mentha‐2,8‐dien‐1‐ol (5.32%–16.22%), 
 <italic>cis‐p</italic>‐mentha‐2,8‐dien‐1‐ol (3.85%–6.39%), 
 <italic>trans‐p</italic>‐mentha‐1(7),8‐dien‐2‐ol (10.45%–20.83%), and 
 <italic>cis‐p</italic>‐mentha‐1(7),8‐dien‐2‐ol (12.30%–18.87%). The limonene is the only monoterpene hydrocarbon found at appreciable content (2.21%–19.28%). These results are in agreement with those obtained by Silou et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>); Yang et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). According to the period of harvesting the samples, the contents of all the 
 <italic>p‐</italic>menthadienol isomers are between 38% and 50%, and these contents are comparable with those of the essential oils of 
 <italic>Cymbopogon giganteus</italic> from Benin (Ayedoun et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>), Ivory Coast (Boti et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>), and Mali (Sidibe et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn3459-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). As the 
 <italic>Cymbopogon giganteus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cymbopogon densiflorus</italic>, it appears that 
 <italic>Elyonurus hensii</italic> is an interesting species for the production of essential oil rich in 
 <italic>p</italic>‐menthadienol isomers.
