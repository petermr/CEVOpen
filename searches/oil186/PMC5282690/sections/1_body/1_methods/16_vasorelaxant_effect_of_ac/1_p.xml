<p class="p">To confirm the involvement of voltage operated, and /or receptor operated calcium channels, and the enhancement of calcium release form internal stores in the vasodilator effect of AcEO, two sets of experiments were carried out as described by [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>]. First, cumulative doses of the AcEO (0.1–100 μg/ml) were added to aorta precontracted with both K
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> (80 mM) and Phen (1 μM). In another set of experiments, a comparative profile of the vasorelaxant effect of ACEO cumulative doses (10
 <sup class="sup">−4</sup>–10
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> mg/ml) and verapamil (10
 <sup class="sup">−8</sup>-10
 <sup class="sup">−6</sup> M) was challenged on the aorta precontracted by K
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> (80 mM).
