 <italic class="italic">v</italic>) was incubated for 12–16 h in the dark at room temperature, and was diluted, before use, with phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in order to obtain an absorbance at 734 nm of 0.7 ± 0.02. Fifty microliters (50 µL) of sample solution (range 300–50 µg/mL) was added to 1 mL of reaction mixture and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 6 min; the absorbance was then recorded at 734 nm using an UV-VIS Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1601). The inhibition (%) of radical scavenging activity was calculated using Equation (1).
