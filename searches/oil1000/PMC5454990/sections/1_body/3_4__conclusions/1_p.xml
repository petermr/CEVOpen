<p class="p">In this present study, the main compounds identified in the essential oils of species collected in Caxiuanã Forest were terpenoid hydrocarbons and oxygenated terpenoids, which had good antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. The main class of chemical compounds displayed a good correlation with chloroplast DNA region (
 <italic class="italic">matK</italic> gene) analysis. However, the analysis of phylogenetic data and specific chemical compounds showed differences. These results suggest that 
 <italic class="italic">matK</italic> gene was not efficient for representing this relationship.
