 <p class="p">This study evaluated the insecticidal activity of garlic, 
  <italic class="italic">Allium sativum</italic> Linnaeus (Amaryllidaceae) essential oil and their principal constituents on 
  <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic>. Garlic essential oil, diallyl disulfide, and diallyl sulfide oil were used to compare the lethal and repellent effects on larvae, pupae and adults of 
  <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic>. Six concentrations of garlic essential oil and their principal constituents were topically applied onto larvae, pupae and adults of this insect. Repellent effect and respiration rate of each constituent was evaluated. The chemical composition of garlic essential oil was also determined and primary compounds were dimethyl trisulfide (19.86%), diallyl disulfide (18.62%), diallyl sulfide (12.67%), diallyl tetrasulfide (11.34%), and 3-vinyl-[4H]-1,2-dithiin (10.11%). Garlic essential oil was toxic to 
  <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> larva, followed by pupa and adult. In toxic compounds, diallyl disulfide was the most toxic than diallyl sulfide for pupa &gt; larva &gt; adult respectively and showing lethal effects at different time points. Garlic essential oil, diallyl disulfide and diallyl sulfide induced symptoms of intoxication and necrosis in larva, pupa, and adult of 
  <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> between 20–40 h after exposure. Garlic essential oil and their compounds caused lethal and sublethal effects on 
  <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> and, therefore, have the potential for pest control.
