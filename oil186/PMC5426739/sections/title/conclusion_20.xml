 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Incorporating sesame and olive oils with flaxseed oil led to improvement in oxidative stability parameters during storage and also had positive effect on nutritional quality of final product. Oil blends with 10 and 15% of flaxseed oil showed the optimal ratio of essential fatty acids but considering all quality parameters, oil blends with 10% flaxseed oil had the highest oxidation stability. This study illustrates that using flaxseed oil in vegetable oil blends can yield an effective level of bioactive compounds, balanced ω
