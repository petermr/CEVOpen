    "Six species of Salvia seeds cultivated and grown in Cumra/Konya (Turkey) were evaluated using headspace gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) combined chemometrics of hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The major volatile compounds in the Salvia species are determined as n-hexanal (present in seven samples), sabinene (present in three samples), α-pinene (present in 13 samples), α-thujone (present in four samples), borneol (present in 11 samples), linalyl acetate (present in 10 samples), β-pinene (present in 13 samples), camphene (present in 13 samples), α-thujene (present in four samples), 2,4(10)-thujadien (present in two samples), β-myrcene (present in seven samples), limonen (present in 12 samples), 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol) (present in 13 samples) and camphor (present in nine samples). The most abundant (%) volatile compounds among all were detected as α-pinene, camphene, β-pinene and eucalyptol. For the first time, chemometrics of HCA and PCA is applied to FTIR and GC-MS data. The classification of all samples is performed on the basis of their chemical similarities and differences."
