 <italic>A. campestris</italic> L. is an Asteraceae plant commonly known as field wormwood; it is a perennial undershrub (30–150 cm height), with branched and ascending brownish-red stems. Leaves are green, the basal are 2–3 pinnatisects, the upper are simple. Inflorescence is an ovoid, heterogamous yellowish capitulum, with an involucral bracts; ray flowers are female, pistillate and fertile, while the disk flowers are sterile, and functionally male [

 <italic>A.campestris</italic> L. known as “Allal”, is used as antidiabetic [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and cutaneous problems [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] effects. Recently a clinical trial conducted on volunteers demonstrated that 
 <italic>A.campestris</italic> L. enhanced 33.3% to 50% decrease in arterial pressure among hypertensive smoker patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In another study, the administration of 
 <italic>A.campestris</italic> L. extract induced antihypertensive effect on envenomed hypertensive rats, and provoked 10% to 30% of hypertension drop, while the pretreatment with the herb extract prevented the rise of hypertension [

 <italic>A. campestris</italic> L. (AcEO) growing in oriental Morocco, to investigate its vasorelaxant and subsequent mechanism of action and to determine its antiplatelet and antioxidant effects.
