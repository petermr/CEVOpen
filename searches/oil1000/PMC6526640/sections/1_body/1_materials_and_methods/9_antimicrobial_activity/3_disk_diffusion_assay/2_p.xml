<p class="p">A disk diffusion assay was used to determine the antibacterial properties. Essential oils of hydrodistillation (HD) and microwave‐assisted extraction (MAE) along with methanol and ethanol extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris </italic>and 
 <italic class="italic">Thymbra spicata</italic> were individually tested against six bacteria. All the bacterial species were first inoculated into tryptic soy agar and incubated overnight at 37°C. After checking for purity, the bacteria were suspended in a 0.9% NaCl solution using a densitometer to adjust the final cell concentration to a 0.5 McFarland number (1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> cfu/ml). Then, 100 µl of the bacterial suspensions was spread on Mueller–Hinton agar. The 6‐mm‐diameter, sterile, empty disks were either impregnated with 10 µl essential oils, or 20 µl of extracts was placed on the inoculated agar. Empty standard antibiotic disks were used as a control. The inoculated plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hr. Antibacterial activity was determined by measuring the zone of inhibition in mm without including the radius of the disk.
