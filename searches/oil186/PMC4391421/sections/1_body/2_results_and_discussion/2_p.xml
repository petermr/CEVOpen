 </bold>. The null hypothesis that the inhibition zone is equal to the disc diameter (6 mm) was rejected for each microorganism at every amount of essential oil with a high significance level (p = 0.00). The main finding of the ANOVA analysis is a strong interaction effect between the type of microorganism and the amount of essential oil (p = 0.00). The highly significant interaction effect adds difficulty in drawing general conclusions on the main effects, even if the two factors are also highly significant (p = 0.00). For example, K. pneumoniae has the highest inhibition zone overall but for the amount of 20 [μL], where E. coli and S. typhimurium have higher values. In order to compare more thoroughly the effect of T. vulgaris on each microorganism (

 </bold>), the results of multiple comparisons, at each oil amount, has to be considered. Tukey’s HSD test reveals that the only microorganisms with non-significant differences in the antimicrobial effect are S. typhimurium and E. coli at all oil amounts, and S. typhimurium, E. coli and C. albicans at 10 [μL]. The observed p-value for the pairwise differences in the above-mentioned cases does not pass acceptable significance levels, being larger than 0.4. All the other pairwise differences are highly significant (p = 0.00).
