<p class="p">In the matter of fact, the antagonizing effect of verapamil and thapsigargin remains debatable, since a persistent vasorelaxation of AcEO was maintained after the pretreatment with both drugs. These results suggest that the vasodilator effect of AcEO may involve the synergetic contribution of both calcium channels; otherwise, AcEO may act concomitantly, on both channels, by blocking VOCC channels, and by activating the SERCA pump, both mechanisms will together participate in an additive and/or synergetic manner to decrease the intracellular levels of calcium leading to a subsequent vasorelaxation.</p>
