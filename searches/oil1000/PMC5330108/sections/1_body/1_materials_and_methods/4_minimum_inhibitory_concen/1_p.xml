<p class="p">Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination was performed using 96-well microtiter plates. The 
 <italic class="italic">F. sporotrichioides</italic> fungal inocula in 96-well microtiter plates were treated with MPE at different concentrations and incubated for 24 h; then, absorbance was measured at 575 nm. Fluconazole was used as the standard and also to compare the cell viability under inverted microscope. The minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) was regarded as the lowest concentration that prevented growth of the fungus following 72 h incubation at 28°C in a fresh potato dextrose agar (PDA) plate, indicating more than 99.5% killing of the original inocula.[
