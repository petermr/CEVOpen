<p id="Par61" class="p">According to the literature, the comparison of the chemical composition of our essential oil (RaEO) with that of 
 <italic class="italic">Rhaponticum carthamoides</italic> roots studied by Skała et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>], revealed important similarity. In fact, these authors reported sesquiterpene hydrocarbons as the main class of chemicals in this essential oil (54.7%). Furthermore, Havlik et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>] noted that sesquiterpene lactones exist in all parts of 
 <italic class="italic">Rhaponticum carthamoides</italic> while the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were identified only in essential oil. On the other hand, Benyelles et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>] reported that the essential oil extracted from the roots of 
 <italic class="italic">R. acaule</italic> was characterized by a large amount of alcohol derivatives (69.2%). Finally it is worth to note that for the essential oil of the aerial part of the same species (
 <italic class="italic">R. acaule</italic>), Boussaada et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>] described a composition richer in diterpenoids (23.7%), aromatic compounds (23.6%) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (21.3%). However, these authors collected the plant material in the completely different habitat of Tunisia. Indeed, the differences between the chemical compositions of the essential oil obtained from the same species may be attributable to environmental factors (geographical, climatic, and seasonal), development stage and genetic variability [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. Additionally, chemotypes and individual variability may appear within the same plant species, resulting in the differences in chemical compositions of the raw materials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>].
