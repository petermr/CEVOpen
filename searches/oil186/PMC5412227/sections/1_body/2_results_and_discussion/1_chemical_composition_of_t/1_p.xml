<p class="p">Hydrodistillation process of the aerial parts of 
 <italic class="italic">D. kotschyi</italic> resulted in formation of 0.16% (w/w) yellowish fragrant oil distillates. The Mass chromatogram of 
 <italic class="italic">D. kotschyi</italic> essential oil is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> and chemical composition of the oils is listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The components were mentioned in order from their elution on the HP-5MS column. Forty three components were identified from the leaf essential oil of 
 <italic class="italic">D. kotschyi</italic> composing 99.9% of the total oil. 11 of the components were monoterpene hydrocarbons (26.7%), 8 of them were oxygenated monoterpenes (43.28%), 15 were sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (22.4%), 7 were oxygenated sesquiterpenes (6.4%) and 2 were other components (1.1%). The monoterpene (70%) and sesquiterpene (29%) were the dominant forming groups of 
 <italic class="italic">D. kotschyi</italic> essential oil. The main monoterpene hydrocarbons were a-pinene (10.34%), Limonene (6.95%), β-Myrcene (3.42%) and β-Pinene (2.18%). The major oxygenated monoterpenes were Geranial (12.08%), Geraniol acetate (10.27%), Geraniol (9.55%) and Neral (8.9%). While, a-Copaene (3.6%), trans^-Farnesene (3.46%), Germacrene-D (3.38%), δ-Cadinene (2.33%) and trans-Caryophyllene (2.04%) were among the main sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. Representative oxygenated sesquiterpenes were vulgarol B (1.78%), a-Cadinol (1.33%) and β- Turmerone (1.32%).
