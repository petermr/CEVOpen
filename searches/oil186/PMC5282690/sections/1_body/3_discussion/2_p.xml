 <sub class="sub">50</sub> = 690 μg/ml) seems to be considerable, though, the absence of a dose-response effect with both AcEO and ascorbic acid seems to be confusing. Indeed, the DPPH test reproducibility is controversial, since it is limited by its lack of specificity; the DPPH assay is not a competitive reaction, because the purple color of the DPPH radical can be easily lost via either hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) or reduction through single electron transfer (SET). Otherwise, the steric accessibility of DPPH radical represent the major limitation of this test that confers a more accessibility of the small molecules to the radical site and which may consequently have a higher antioxidant effect. On the other hand, a large brand of antioxidant compounds with peroxyl radicals may react slowly or may even be inert in reaction to DPPH which is a nitrogen radical in the first place [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">77</xref>]. All these artefacts may interfere with the actual antioxidant effect of the AcEO and the ascorbic acid used as reference, which may blind their effective antioxidant effect and omit the dose-response efficiency of both substrates. On the other hand, the DPPH radical scavenging obtained with AcEO seems to be very important when compared to that observed with the essential oil obtained from the aerial part (IC
