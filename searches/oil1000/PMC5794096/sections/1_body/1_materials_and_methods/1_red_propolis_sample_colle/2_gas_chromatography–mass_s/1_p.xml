<p class="p">Chemical composition analysis was performed using a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass-selective detector (Hewlett Packard 6890/MSD5973, Palo Alto, USA) equipped with the HP ChemStation software and the Wiley 275 library. A capillary column composed of HP-INNOWax fused silica (30 m × 250 μm) of 0.50 μm film thickness (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, USA) was used for the study. The temperature program used was as follows: the column temperature started at 40 °C (held for 8 min) and was increased to 180 °C at 3 °C/min and then to 230 °C (held for 20 min) at 20 °C/min; the injector was at a temperature of 250 °C and the interface at 280 °C. The split ratio was 1:100, helium was the carrier gas (56 kPa), the flow rate was 1 mL/min, the ionization energy was 70 eV, and the injected volume was 0.4 mL.</p>
