<p class="p">Reactive oxygen species are involved in the pathological development of many important human diseases, thus antioxidants play a crucial role in human health due to their unquestionable beneficial effects on living organisms that enable them to overcome oxidative injuries, and modulate biological pathways and membrane functionality [
 <xref rid="B23-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. In this article, the authors conducted the analysis of antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties of HEO by using several antioxidant assays (hydrogen atom transfer and electron transfer-based methods) in order to check their behaviour under different reaction environments and mechanism typologies. This aspect is often overlooked but is critical in order to establish the structure-scavenging activity relationship of the major components of the phytocomplex investigated [
