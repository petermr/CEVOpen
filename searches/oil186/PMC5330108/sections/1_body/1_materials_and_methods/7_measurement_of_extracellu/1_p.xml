<p>The extracellular pH was measured by Shao 
 <italic>et al</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] method. The extracellular pH of 
 <italic>F. sporotrichioides</italic> was determined by eutech pH meter. The fungal suspension 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL were added to 20 mL PDB and incubated in a moist chamber at 28°C ± 2°C for 2 days. The mixtures were centrifuged at 4000 g for 20 min, and the resulting pellet was collected, washed for 2–3 times with sterilized double-distilled water, and resuspended in 20 mL sterilized double-distilled water. After the addition of the MPE, the extracellular pH was determined.
