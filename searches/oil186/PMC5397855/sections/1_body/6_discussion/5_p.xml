<p>The insects exposed to the garlic essential oil and toxic compounds displayed altered locomotion activity, and muscle contractions that were observed in detailed descriptions at high concentrations in LC
 <sub>50</sub> and LC
 <sub>90</sub> test. In some individuals, the paralysis was constant with concentrations near the LC
 <sub>50</sub> without recovery signs. Paralysis and muscle contractions in individuals of 
 <italic>T. molitor</italic> at LC
 <sub>50</sub> can be explained by the toxic effect in the nervous system of the same. The rapid toxicity of essential oils and their constituents in insects indicates neurotoxic action as reported to
