<p>Identification of components was based on the comparison of their MS spectra with those of laboratory-made MS library, commercial libraries (NIST 98.1, Wiley Registry of Mass Spectral Data, 8th Ed. and MassFinder 4.1, Hamburg, Germany) and with the literature data [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-00417" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-00417" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] along with the retention indices (Rtx-1, MassFinder 4.1) associated with a series of alkanes with linear interpolation (C8-C26). The quantitative analysis (expressed as percentages of each component) was carried out by peak area normalization measurements without correction factors.
