<p class="p">Logarithmic phase bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 5 min, washed three times, and resuspended in PBS (pH 7.4). Tested bacteria were treated with different concentrations of samples and incubated at 37 °C. After 1 h and 2 h, cells containing approximately 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> CFU/mL were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 5 min and stained for 15 min with the equal volume of 1 mg/mL PI in the dark at room temperature. Ten microliters of the stained bacterial suspensions were dropped onto glass slides and covered with coverslips, and images were captured by a fluorescence microscope (Leica, DMi8).
