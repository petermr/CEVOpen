<p id="Par30">Differences in the chemical constituents of 
 <italic>Tagetes</italic> oil has also been allotted to some environmental variables like soil, temperature and the total period of exposure to sunlight [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The differences in the chemical constituents of the EO of 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> flower could be attributed to many factors which could include but not limited to location, stage of cultivation, season of cultivation and part of the plant used. The chemical composition of the essential oil of 
 <italic>T. mimuta</italic> flower shows various classes of terpenes ranging from hemiterpenes to sesquiterpenes. Similar study done by Wanzala &amp; Ogoma, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] showed that 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> essential oil contains a wide range of secondary metabolites mainly sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes including β-ocimene, camphene and bicyclogermacrene and their report corroborates with our result. At 0.5 mg/mL concentration, the EO was 72% while vitamin C was 76% and the EO of 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> flower displayed lower DPPH radical scavenging activity at various concentrations compared to the vitamin C as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Our result is similar with the report of Muyima et al., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] on inhibitory effect of the essential oil of 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> against DPPH radical. The action implicated in antioxidant activity assay is the capacity of the molecule to release hydrogen atom to a radical which is the key factor that is involved in free radical scavenging activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. This effect is displayed as the colour DPPH• fades away (purple to yellow) in the test solution due to the production of neutral DPPH-H molecule upon absorption of hydrogen atom from an antiradical [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The sample antioxidant strength is established by the decreased of UV absorption at 517 nm. Study has shown that DPPH method is not an exact radical specie assay but a general radical scavenging strength of an antioxidant compound [
