Studying PBDs and their animal models has greatly contributed to our current knowledge about peroxisomal functions. Very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) accumulation has long been suggested as a major disease-mediating factor, although the exact pathological consequences are unclear. Here, we show that a <italic>Drosophila Pex19</italic> mutant is lethal due to a deficit in medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs). Increased lipolysis mediated by Lipase 3 (Lip3) leads to accumulation of free fatty acids and lipotoxicity. Administration of MCFAs prevents lipolysis and decreases the free fatty acid load. This drastically increases the survival rate of <italic>Pex19</italic> mutants without reducing VLCFA accumulation. We identified a mediator of MCFA-induced lipolysis repression, the ceramide synthase Schlank, which reacts to MCFA supplementation by increasing its repressive action on <italic>lip3</italic>. This shifts our understanding of the key defects in peroxisome-deficient cells away from elevated VLCFA levels toward elevated lipolysis and shows that loss of this important organelle can be compensated by a dietary adjustment.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Peroxisomes are organelles that contain several enzymes and fatty acids required for many metabolic tasks in the cell, and upon peroxisome loss, their educts accumulate. One example is the accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) with a chain length of more than 20 carbons. These fatty acids cannot be oxidized in mitochondria but are exclusively degraded in peroxisomes. Lowering increased VLCFA levels is sometimes attempted as a treatment option for human disorders with peroxisomal dysfunction, although its effectiveness remains unclear. Here, we have analyzed this process in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and found that peroxisomal loss results not only in VLCFA accumulation but also in a reduction of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs). We could show that this is due to a state of high lipolysis and increased mitochondrial activity. By supplementation with MCFAs from coconut oil, we were able to rescue mitochondrial damage and lethality observed in peroxisome-deficient flies. We found that this process is mediated by the ceramide synthase Schlank, which acts as a transcription factor and shuttles between nuclear membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in response to MCFA availability. We conclude that peroxisome loss triggers the accumulation of free fatty acids and mitochondrial damage in flies and that these effects can be rescued by a diet rich in MCFAs.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>German Research Association (DFG) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trr83.uni-heidelberg.de/">http://www.trr83.uni-heidelberg.de/</ext-link> (grant number TRR83 TP B1).

De Duve as catalase-containing organelles important for the degradation of hydrogen peroxide [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Recently, it has become more and more apparent that they harbor much more complex metabolic functions, which are still incompletely understood. In mammalian cells, they are involved in the &#x003b2;-oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), the formation of ether phospholipids (e.g., plasmalogens), the catabolism of branched-chain fatty acids, the production of bile acids, polyamine oxidation, and amino acid catabolism [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. VLCFAs (chain length of C22 and more) do not enter the mitochondria via the carnitine shuttle carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) and thus cannot be &#x003b2;-oxidized for energy gain. Instead, VLCFAs are exclusively oxidized in peroxisomes. They (and to a lesser extent, long-chain fatty acids [LCFAs], which are, however, predominantly oxidized in mitochondria) enter the peroxisomes after activation into acyl-CoA, where they are shortened by the peroxisomal &#x003b2;-oxidation machinery. The resulting short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) are transported out of the peroxisome via the carnitine-shuttles carnitine O-acetyltransferase (CRAT) and carnitine O-octanoyltransferase (CROT) and enter the mitochondrion via carnitine shuttle or thiolase-dependent transport. In the mitochondria, they are further oxidized to acetyl-coA and feed the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the electron transport chain [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is unclear whether and to what extent the shortened peroxisomal products contribute to mitochondrial energy production, but overall, the energy gain from VLCFAs is minor in comparison to S/M/LCFAs because of their low abundance [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In yeast cells, peroxisomes are required for the &#x003b2;-oxidation of MCFAs [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], since there they are the only site of fatty acid oxidation.</p><p>The complex metabolic functions of peroxisomes are reflected by the multiform pathologic symptoms of peroxisomal biogenesis disorders (PBDs) of the Zellweger syndrome spectrum, whose study has greatly contributed to our understanding of peroxisomal function. PBDs are rare genetic diseases caused by mutations in one of the approximately 16 peroxin (PEX) genes, which are involved in the assembly and maintenance of peroxisomes. One major disease-causing effect is thought to be the accumulation of VLCFA-containing lipids, which occurs not only in PBDs but also in defects specific to the peroxisomal &#x003b2;-oxidation machinery, like X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) or single enzyme defects, and is thought to be a result of abolished degradation of VLCFAs in peroxisomes. While accumulation of VLCFAs in these peroxisomal diseases is undisputed, there are still some doubts as to the exact underlying mechanism. Mice lacking a functional VLC-acyl-CoA synthetase, which is needed to activate VLCFAs in order to enter the peroxisome, show normal VLCFA levels, although peroxisomal &#x003b2;-oxidation is strongly reduced [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Similarly, the exact pathological effect downstream of accumulating VLCFAs remains elusive, although detrimental effects on mitochondria are postulated by many authors. Mitochondrial defects are indeed often observed in peroxisomal diseases [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and in vitro assays show mitotoxic effects of VLCFAs added to cells [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the majority of accumulating VLCFAs in peroxisomal diseases is shown to be contained in lipids and not as free fatty acids [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], also called nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs), in which form they were added to the cells. Furthermore, a number of authors observe normal mitochondrial function and morphology in VLCFA-enriched tissues carrying an X-ALD causing ATP-binding cassette family D transporter (ABCD1) mutation [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which suggests other pathological mechanisms involved in mitochondrial dysfunction in PBDs.</p><p>The peroxisomal biogenesis and assembly machinery is well conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the present study, we use a <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster Pex19</italic> mutant [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] as a genetically tractable in vivo model system to elucidate the impact of peroxisomal deficiency on cellular and organismal metabolism. Pex19 is a predominantly cytoplasmic peroxisomal core factor and essential for both the import of peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) and the de novo formation of peroxisomes [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Together with Pex3 and Pex16, it is responsible for the translocation of membrane proteins and membrane vesicle assembly [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Pex19 loss of function specifically leads to Zellweger syndrome, the severest form of PBDs. We have previously shown that major hallmarks of Zellweger syndrome are recapitulated in <italic>Pex19</italic> mutant flies, like absence of peroxisomes, VLCFA accumulation, mitochondrial abnormalities, and severely decreased viability. Furthermore, we have identified increased free fatty acids as a mitochondria-damaging agent in these flies. Free fatty acids accumulate as a result from a metabolic shift toward maximal lipid catabolism with severely increased lipolysis, which is caused by altered hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (Hnf4) activity [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Here, we identify an imbalance in fatty acid composition in <italic>Pex19</italic> flies as a pathology-causing effect. While VLCFAs accumulate as expected in <italic>Pex19</italic> mutants, M/LCFAs are reduced to an extent far surpassing the relative effect caused by increased VLCFAs. This reduction is especially pronounced for fatty acids of 12 and 14 carbons (C12:0, C14:0, C14:1), and we here present evidence that this MCFA gap is involved in pathology progression in the absence of peroxisomes. Feeding a diet rich in C12- and C14-containing coconut oil (or other natural oils of similar composition) rescues <italic>Pex19</italic> flies into adulthood and ameliorates their metabolic imbalance, which is not achieved by feeding LCFA-containing oils. Similar rescues of <italic>Pex2</italic> and <italic>Pex3</italic> mutants unequivocally prove that peroxisomal absence, and not Pex19 loss itself, is responsible for the metabolic phenotype observed in <italic>Pex19</italic> mutants. We show that MCFA shortage results in a shift in subcellular localization of the ceramide synthase Schlank. Schlank was recently reported to harbor a secondary function as a transcription factor and was shown to repress <italic>lipase 3</italic> (<italic>lip3</italic>) [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Consistently, we observe severely increased expression of <italic>lip3</italic> expression in <italic>Pex19</italic> mutants. The feeding of coconut oil results in normalizing the activity of Schlank, concomitant with reduced <italic>lip3</italic> transcription, ultimately resulting in reduced lipolysis, reduced free fatty acid levels, and amelioration of the mitochondrial phenotype. Furthermore, we present evidence that this general pathological mechanism is also present in a Pex19-deficient patient cell line, thereby opening up a new path in the search for future therapies for PBDs and other peroxisomal diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Filling the MCFA gap rescues <italic>Pex19</italic> mutants</title><p>As we described previously, flies carrying a deletion of the <italic>Pex19</italic> gene locus (<italic>Pex19</italic><sup><italic>&#x00394;F7</italic></sup>, from here on referred to as <italic>Pex19</italic> mutants) lose their peroxisomes during larval development and die predominantly during the pupal stage [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. When analyzing the fatty acid profile of <italic>Pex19</italic> mutant pupae, we found an unexpected shortage in M- and LCFAs in addition to the well-described accumulation of VLCFAs (SCFAs, MCFAs, LCFAs, and VLCFAs here refer to chain lengths of 4&#x02013;8, 10&#x02013;14, 16&#x02013;18, and &#x02265;20 C-atoms, respectively). Direct comparison of the absolute concentration of all fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) revealed a significant reduction of M/LCFAs, especially C12:0 and C14:0, while FAMEs of C20:0, C24:0, C26:0, and C28:0 are enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004893.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), which is consistent with our previous findings in larvae [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. M/LCFAs can fuel mitochondrial ATP production and do not depend on chain shortening by the peroxisome before they can enter the mitochondrion and the TCA cycle. Since we suspected an energy deficit in <italic>Pex19</italic> mutants, we sought to fill the gap in MCFAs by dietary modifications. Freshly hatched larvae were kept by default on a high-caloric diet (apple juice agar plates with fresh yeast paste) rich in both carbohydrates and proteins. To avoid problems with toxicity or food avoidance, we used natural oils as sources for fatty acids with varying chain length. In order to minimize adverse effects of a high-fat diet [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we added only 5% of the different natural oils to the yeast paste and analyzed <italic>Pex19</italic> mutant survival. We found that oils containing high amounts of lauric acid (C12:0) and myristic acid (C14:0)&#x02014;like coconut oil, babassu oil, or palm kernel oil [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]&#x02014;have a positive effect on the survival rate of <italic>Pex19</italic> mutants, yielding 55% of adult flies as compared to 20% on control food.

On the other hand, there are a number of contradictory studies observing normal mitochondrial function and morphology in VLCFA-enriched tissues [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which suggests other, so-far unidentified pathological mechanisms. Here, we provide evidence that in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> PBD model, mitotoxic effects of peroxisomal loss can be ameliorated without altering overall VLCFA levels by providing MCFAs, which are depleted in <italic>Pex19</italic> mutants. The central finding of our study is the observation that MCFA shortage plays a more important role in the pathophysiology of peroxisome loss than VLCFA accumulation. MCFA shortage correlates with free fatty acid accumulation and subsequent mitochondrial damage, which can be overcome by administering MCFA-rich coconut oil. Importantly, this measure does not reduce VLCFA levels in <italic>Pex19</italic> mutants and even increases VLCFA levels in the wild type, although mitochondrial pathology is clearly improved and neurodegeneration and lethality counteracted. While VLCFAs are obviously mitotoxic in micromolar concentrations when administered to cells or tissue as free fatty acids [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], we argue that their accumulation in vivo is, while certainly not without adverse consequence for the organism, less severe due to their main presence in lipids instead of in their nonesterified form. Furthermore, we measure VLCFA concentrations in the nanomolar, not micromolar, range. Instead, we observe increased levels of free fatty acids as the mitotoxic agent, which accumulate as the result of dysregulated lipolysis.</p><p>Free fatty acids are toxic for the cell; therefore, lipolysis and degradation of fatty acids is tightly coregulated to keep the overall level of free fatty acids low and avoid lipotoxic effects on mitochondria. This is achieved by their role as activating ligands for Hnf4 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (peroxisome proliferator&#x02013;activated receptors [PPARs] in vertebrates) [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], which in response induces a lipid catabolic program. In the absence of peroxisomes, we observe that this program is &#x0201c;maxed out&#x0201d; and produces more fatty acids than the mitochondria can handle (as indicated by maximal mitochondrial &#x003b2;-oxidation in <italic>Pex19</italic> mutants, even when fed the rescue diet), resulting in mitochondrial damage and ultimately energy deficit and death. It was shown that peroxisomes can protect mitochondria from fatty acid overload in the myocardium after ischemia-reperfusion injury: if mitochondrial &#x003b2;-oxidation is reduced, peroxisomal &#x003b2;-oxidation increases, resulting in lowering overall free fatty acid levels and protection of the myocardial cells [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], which is consistent with a general role of peroxisomes in regulating overall free fatty acid levels and mitoprotection.</p><p>We unravel a mechanism by which MCFA shortage mediates Schlank nuclear exclusion, allowing for high expression of <italic>lip3</italic>, thereby inducing the production of free fatty acids. In a previous study, we identified Hnf4 as the central regulator of the resulting lipid catabolic program: the increase in free fatty acid levels caused by <italic>lip3</italic> up-regulation induces a spiral of hyperactive Hnf4 signaling, more lipolysis, and mitochondrial swelling [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

The enzymes responsible for producing the sphingosine precursor sphinganine are the serine palmytoyltransferases Spt1 and Spt2 (the latter is known as Lace in <italic>Drosophila</italic>). Of note, the educts for the condensation reaction catalyzed by Lace are serine and the MCFA lauric acid, which is the main fatty acid present in coconut oil (for a review on <italic>Drosophila</italic> sphingolipid metabolism, see [<xref rid="pbio.2004893.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]). The medium-chain sphinganine is then further oxidized to yield sphingosine, which is an educt for the acylation reaction catalyzed by Schlank to produce ceramide. It is therefore conceivable that providing lauric acid from coconut oil rescues <italic>Pex19</italic> mutants by feeding into sphinganine/sphingosine production, which allows Schlank to enrich in the nuclear membrane and repress <italic>lip3</italic> expression, thereby reducing lipotoxicity and lethality of <italic>Pex19</italic> mutants.</p><p>We show that mitochondrial damage, lipotoxicity, and Schlank mislocalization contribute substantially to pathophysiological defects not only in <italic>Pex19</italic> mutants but also in flies deficient in <italic>Pex2</italic> and <italic>Pex3</italic>, and that principle aspects of this cascade are conserved in human cells.</p><p>While we do not rule out that accumulation of VLCFA contributes to phenotype progression in PBDs, we identify a different lethality-inducing cascade driven by Hnf4 and Schlank that results in free fatty acid overload and mitotoxicity, independent of VLCFA levels.

A minimum of <italic>n</italic> = 7 was analyzed for each condition. C15:0 and C27:0 standards were added, and samples were incubated for 45 minutes at 80 &#x000b0;C. Methyl esters were collected by addition of hexane and a 0.9% NaCl solution. The hexane phase was collected in a new glass vial and concentrated by vaporization.

In brief, 3 third-instar larvae were weighed and homogenized in 20 &#x003bc;l of 1 M phosphate buffer per mg tissue. Then, 25 &#x003bc;l of the supernatant were transferred to 500 &#x003bc;l of Chloroform/Heptane 4:3, and lipids were extracted by shaking the vial for 5 minutes. Unspecific background provoked by phospholipids was circumvented by addition of 23 mg of activated silicic acid. Next, 300 &#x003bc;l of the chloroform phase was transferred to 250 &#x003bc;l of Cu-TEA (copper-triethanolamine). After shaking and centrifuging, 150 &#x003bc;l of the organic phase was transferred to fresh cups. Liquid was evaporated in a 60 &#x000b0;C heat block, and lipids were dissolved in 100 &#x003bc;l of 100% ethanol. Copper was detected by complexation with a mixture of dicarbazone&#x02013;dicarbazide, and the color intensity was measured in a 96-well plate at 550 nm in a TECAN plate reader. Each experiment was conducted at a minimum of 5 biological replicates.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>&#x003b2;-oxidation measurements</title><p>Six larvae per genotype were washed with PBS, and their weight was recorded for normalization purposes. The larvae were inverted in ice-cold PBS and permeabilized in ice-cold BIOPS buffer (2.77 mM CaK<sub>2</sub>EGTA, 7.23 mM K<sub>2</sub>EGTA, 5.77 mM Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 6.56 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O, 20 mM taurine, 15 mM Na<sub>2</sub>.phosphocreatine, 20 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM DTT, 50 mM MES) containing 100 &#x003bc;g/mL saponin (fresh) at 4 &#x000b0;C with gentle rocking for 10 minutes. Then, the larvae were equilibriated in respiration medium (MiR05, 0.5 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl2*6H2O, 60 mM K-Lactobionate [lactobionic acid is dissolved in H2O, and pH is adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH], 20 mM Taurine, 10 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM HEPES, 110 mM sucrose, 1 g/L fatty acid&#x02013;free BSA) supplemented with 0.5 mM carnitine. The larvae were added into the oxygraph chambers, and oxygen concentration was brought to around 500 &#x003bc;M by using catalase and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. After basal respiration was recorded, 5 &#x003bc;M palmitoyl-CoA was added to the chamber. Fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation was induced by adding complex I substrates, electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) substrates, and ADP (10 mM proline, 10 mM pyruvate, 5 mM malate, 5 mM glutamate, 2 mM ADP, and 15 mM glycerol-3-phosphate). After that, etomoxir was added at the indicated concentrations to block fatty acid transfer into mitochondria via CPT I, thereby blocking &#x003b2;-oxidation and leaving complex I&#x02013;dependent respiration. Finally, residual oxygen consumption (ROX) was measured by inhibiting complex III with antimycin A. All values were corrected for ROX. &#x003b2;-oxidation was calculated by subtracting etomoxir-resistant respiration from respiration in the presence of all substrates. Each measurement was repeated at least 3 times (biological replicates).</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Real-time qPCR</title><p>Whole RNA of third-instar larvae was isolated using TriFast reagent (peqlab). Tissue was homogenized using a Precellys 24 homogenizer (peqlab).
