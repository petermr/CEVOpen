Lake District of Turkey located on the boundary between Mediterranean and Iran-Turan geographic regions is very rich in the number of plant species, particularly in Apiaceae family. It was reported that more than 70 taxa included in the Apiaceae family has been found in the floristic studies conducted in the region (Davis, 1988; Sağıroğlu and Duman, 2006; Yıldırımlı and Selvi, 2006; Pimenov and Leonov, 2014).
