<p class="p">The SoEO was assayed on 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> larvae and 
 <italic class="italic">T. castaneum</italic> adults. The percentage of mortality produced by each strain at different SoEO concentrations was shown in Figure 1
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">(Fig. 1)</xref>. Mortality increased by increasing the SoEO concentration, which revealed a dose-dependent effect. The LC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50</sub> of SoEO was also calculated for each pest species. The fumigant assay indicated that SoEO showed interesting insecticidal activity against the third instar larvae of 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis</italic> and adults of 
 <italic class="italic">T. castaneum</italic>, with an LC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50</sub> value of 55.99 ± 7.95 µl/L air and 97.43 ± 11.85 µl/L air, respectively. To our knowledge, there is limited information concerning the activity of SoEO against Lepidopteran larvae 
 <italic class="italic">S. littoralis. </italic>Ben El Hadj Ali et al. (2015[
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]) reported an approximately similar toxicity exhibited by 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus algeriensis</italic> EO against the third instar larvae of
 <italic class="italic"> S. littoralis</italic>. The high insecticidal potency of SoEO could be attributed to monoterpenoids compounds such as camphene, α-pinene and γ-terpinene, which were well known for their strong insecticidal activity against 
 <italic class="italic">T. castaneum</italic> adults (Kim et al., 2010[
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]). In addition, 1-8-cineole and limonene possessed fumigant toxicity against this insect (Lee et al., 2004[
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]). These monoterpenoids are known for their inhibitory effects on acetylcholinesterase, a key enzyme in the insect central nervous system (Abdelgaleil et al., 2009[
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]; Zarrad et al., 2015[
 <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]). Caryophyllene oxide, a sesquiterpene compound, also showed high fumigant toxicity against this pest. Its high toxicity may result from the inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport system because changes in the concentration of oxygen or carbon dioxide may affect respiration rate of 
 <italic class="italic">T. castaneum</italic>, thus eliciting fumigant toxicity effects (Emekci et al., 2004[
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]).
