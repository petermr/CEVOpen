<p>The isolation yield was 1.25% (v/w), based on dry plant material and confirmed that the plant analyzed meets the requirements of pharmaceutical quality for thyme as EO source [

 </bold>]. The chemical composition determined by GC/ MS is presented in 
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>
 </bold>. Fifteen components representing 99.91% of the total detected constituents were identified. The major components were p-cymene (8.41%), γ-terpinene (30.90%) and thymol (47.59%), which suggests that the EO analyzed belongs to the thymol chemotype in agreement with those previously reported in Romania [

  <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
 </bold>]. The other components were present in a total amount of less than 13.01%. The chemical composition of the EO analyzed by us is very different from that previously reported in Morocco and Spain for the same species of thyme [

 </bold>,
 <bold>
  <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
 </bold>]. Similar studies in Poland, Iran, Spain and Italy, respectively, reported as major compounds in the T. vulgaris EO p-cymene, γ-terpinene and thymol [

  <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
 </bold>-

  <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
