<p>For detail study, separate samples of 100 grams each of desi ghee were heated in frying pan without any cooking material with same conditions and temperatures at 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 200 and 250°C for a time period of five minutes for acquiring their fluorescence spectra. At 250°C, desi ghee started to smoke and is labelled as its smoke point. In order to confirm the fluorescence bands of ghee samples, the fluorescence spectra of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (Nature’s Bounty, Inc. Bohemia NY 11716 U.S.A.), vitamin K (Munawar Pharma Lahore, Pakistan), vitamin D (SAMI Pharmaceuticals Ltd.) and vitamin A (Matrix Pharma Karachi, Pakistan), vitamin E (Tocopherol (Evion capsules) Merck pharma, Pakistan) were purchased from the local market of Islamabad, Pakistan and their spectra were recorded and compared.</p>
