   <italic>Purpose:</italic>
  </bold> Suitable ratio of essential fatty acids has an important role in maintaining good health. There is no pure oil with an ideal fatty acid composition and oxidative stability. The main goal of the present study was to evaluate the physical, chemical and nutritional properties of oil obtained by blending flaxseed oil as a rich source of ω
  <sub>3</sub> fatty acids with sesame and olive oils.

  <bold>
   <italic>Methods:</italic>
  </bold> Three different ratios (65:30:5, 60:30:10 and 55:30:15) were prepared using olive, sesame and flaxseed oils. These mixtures were stored at 4°C and 24°C and their quality and physicochemical properties were determined by measuring the fatty acid composition, phenolic compound, peroxide, anisidine values and schaal tests.

  <bold>
   <italic>Results:</italic>
  </bold> Fatty acid composition indicated that adding 10% and 15% flaxseed oil into blends have suitable ratio of essential fatty acids. The sample which contained 5% flaxseed oil had the highest phenolic content among treatments and these compounds showed a significant decrease during storage. A significant increase (p&lt;0.05) was observed in peroxide values of all samples during storage. Increasing the flaxseed oil content in the blends, lead to an increase of the anisidine value.

  <bold>
   <italic>Conclusion:</italic>
  </bold> Blending sesame and olive oils with flaxseed oil produced oil blends with a good balance of essential fatty acids. Although peroxide and anisidine values increased during storage of the oil blends; the blends were of a good quality for home and industrial use.
