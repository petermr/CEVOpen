<p id="Par6" class="p">Fermentation has been used in many parts of world for the preparation of flavoured fish products which can add variety to the diet and contribute greatly to the general nutrition of large populations. Because of this, the development of such products is of great importance and a large number of traditional methods have evolved [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. In Africa, salting and drying of fish for preservation is often accompanied by fermentation. But the period is short (a few days) and the product is not transformed into a paste or sauce. The products are all characterized by a strong odour do to the uncontrolled fermentation process. The characteristic smell of fermented fish is the result of enzymatic and microbiological activity in the fish muscle. These fermentation process was done by microorganisms. Indeed, fish in its natural environment has its own microflora in the slime on its body, in its gut and in its gills. These microorganisms, as well as the enzymes in the tissues of the fish, bring about putrefactive changes in fish when it dies. Furthermore, the microorganisms generally present in the salt used for salting also contribute to the degradative changes in the fish. There are halophile, halotolerant or osmophile microorganisms. Generally, halophile microrganisms grow optimally at high salt concentrations but are unable to grow in salt-free media. Halotolerant microorganisms grow best without significant amounts of salt but can also grow in concentrations higher than that of sea water. Osmophile microorganisms are those which can grow under high osmotic pressure. The combined action of the fermentative activity of these microorganisms in uncontrolled fermentation process contributes to the proliferation of undesirable and pathogenic microorganisms as highlighted by the present study (Table
