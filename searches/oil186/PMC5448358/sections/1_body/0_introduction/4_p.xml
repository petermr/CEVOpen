<p>In a previous study of 
 <italic>Elyonurus hensii</italic> from Congo‐Brazzaville, (1) the volatile components from the stems and the roots were obtained by hydrodistillation and head‐space solid phase microextraction (HS‐SPME), and (2) for the extracts obtained with methanol, ethyl acetate and dichloromethane, the antioxidant activities of the extracts were demonstrated and compared. The essential oil of 
 <italic>Elyonurus hensii</italic> did not have significant properties of DPPH and ABTS
 <sup>.+</sup> for either the stems or the roots. However, the solvent extracts are effective antioxidants according to in vitro assays. The authors conclude that the extracts of 
 <italic>Elyonurus hensii</italic> have potential as natural additives for the food and pharmaceutical industries (Yang et al.,
