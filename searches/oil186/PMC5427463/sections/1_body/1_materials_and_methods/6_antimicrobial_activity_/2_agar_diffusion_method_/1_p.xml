<p>The antimicrobial activities of the SoEO were assessed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> by well diffusion method (Güven et al., 2006[
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]), with some modifications. The SoEO was dissolved in ethanol/water (v/v) to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL and then filtered through a sterile Millipore membrane filter (diameter 0.45 µm) and used for activity assay. 100 μL of indicator strain (approximately 10
 <sup>6 </sup>CFU/mL) were displayed on plate filled with LB or PDA. Wells (06 mm diameter) were drilled in the agar plates with a sterile Pasteur pipette and then 50 µL of SoEO were added to the wells. The plates were incubated at the optimal temperature of the indicator organism and inhibition zone diameters were measured after appropriate time as described above. Gentamicin (10 μg/wells) was used as a positive control in antibacterial tests, while amphotericin B (20 μg/wells) was used as a positive control in antifungal activity. Negative control consisted of 50 % ethanol which is used to dissolve the SoEO. The experiments were done in triplicate and repeated twice.
