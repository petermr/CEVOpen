<p class="p">MCF-7 human mammary adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC No. HTB-22) were cultured in RPMI (Roswell Park Memorial Institute) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 30 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid buffer), NaHCO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3</sub>, and penicillin streptomycin. The cytotoxicity of the essential oils on MCF-7 cells was determined using the 96-well MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay as reported previously [

 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells/well and a volume of 100 μL in each well. The plate was then labeled and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub> for 48 h. After 48 h, the cells reached 70–80% confluent growth. The supernatant fluid was gently aspirated (without touching the bottom of the well to avoid removing cells) and replaced with 100 μL growth medium that contained either 1.0 or 0.5 μL of essential oil (1% in DMSO), to give final concentrations of 100 and 50 μg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The plate was then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub> for 48 h. After 48 h, the liquid was gently aspirated from each well. In a tube, 10 mL feeding medium was mixed with 2 mL of MTT stock solution (and was protected from light). Into each well, 100 µL of the MTT solution was added and the pre-read absorbance was immediately measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm (using a Molecular Devices Spectra Max Plus 384 microplate reader). Formazan crystals were formed over the course of 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sub>. After 4 h, DMSO was used to dissolve the purple crystals. The amount of MTT-formazan produced was determined spectrophotometrically at 570 nm. Growing medium, DMSO, and tingenone (100 μg·mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) served as negative, compound, and positive controls, respectively. Solutions were added to wells in eight replicates. Average absorbances, standard deviations, and percent kill ratios (% kill

 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">control</sub>) were calculated. Median inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">50</sub>) were determined using the Reed-Muench method [
