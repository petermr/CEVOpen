<p>All essential oils displayed high antimicrobial activity against

 <sup>−1</sup>). 
 <bold>Cau-L</bold> and

 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Most essential oil components show only marginal activity against this organism. The antibacterial activities against the other bacteria are consistent with the activities of the essential oil components (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijms-18-01081-t003">Table 3</xref>). On the other hand, the cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 cells did not display variation in the median inhibitory concentration (IC

 <sup>−1</sup> (
