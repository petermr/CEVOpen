<p id="Par32">The MIC values of the EO of 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> against the test bacteria strains as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> displayed that the EO was more active against Gram-negative than Gram-positive bacteria and this report is not in agreement with the report of Senatore et al., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and they reported that the MIC value of the EO of 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> from UK for Gram-positive bacteria were 6.25–25 μg/mL and 25–50 μg/mL for Gram-negative bacteria. Minimum bactericidal concentration of any test sample is the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agents capable of killing or preventing any visible bacteria growth after twenty four hours of incubation under standardized sets of conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The EO showed MBC value of 0.06 mg/mL for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>E. cloacae</italic> while at higher concentration of 0.125 mg/mL, it was bactericidal against 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> spp. and the MBC value for 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>uberis</italic> was recorded at 0.5 mg/mL (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The essential oil of 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> flower had greater bactericidal effect against 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>uberis</italic>, 
 <italic>Vibro</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>coli</italic>. This suggests that the essential oil of 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>minuta</italic> flower may contain some bioactive compounds that could be efficacious in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases that are linked to these organisms resistant to some antibiotics.
