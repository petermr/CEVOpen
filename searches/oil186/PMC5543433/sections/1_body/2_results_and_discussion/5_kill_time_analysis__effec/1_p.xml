<p id="Par54">Controlling 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> in food has become a major preoccupation in the food industry and storage. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the efficacy of 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO to repress the growth of 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> ATCC 19117 in raw minced meat beef under storage at 4 °C. Therefore, the effect of 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO on 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> ATCC 19117 was investigated to confirm its effect and clarify its action mechanism. The kinetics was performed using different concentrations of 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO (2 MIC and 3MIC). As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, at day 0, the number of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> was found to be the same for all meat samples (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). Over the storage period at 4 °C, numbers of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> were higher in untreated samples than treated samples with 0.06 and 0.312 mg of 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO /g of raw minced meat beef: at a concentration of 2 and 3 MIC, growth of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> count was reduced by 2.5 log cycles after 4 and 6 days of storage at 4 °C respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
