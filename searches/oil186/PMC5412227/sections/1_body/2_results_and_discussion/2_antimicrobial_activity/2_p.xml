<p class="p">The observed antibacterial properties of the essential oils against various bacteria were different, ranging from strong antibacterial activity (inhibition zone &gt; 20 mm) to moderate activity (inhibition zone &lt; 12-20 mm) and even no inhibition (zone &lt; 12 mm) (Orlanda and Nascimento 2015). Based on the width of the inhibition zone diameter, essential oils exhibits the strongest antibacterial activity against most Gram-positive organisms (except for 
 <italic class="italic">E. faecalis)</italic> and a few Gram-negative organisms, including 
 <italic class="italic">S. typhi, S. paratyphi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella enterica</italic> (p &lt; 0.01). The weakest antibacterial activity was observed against 
 <italic class="italic">P. aeruginosa</italic>, with a 10.40 ± 0.05 mm zone of inhibition (p&lt;0.01).
