<p>Herbs and spices, grown wildly in various regions of the world have been used for culinary and medicinal purposes since ancient times. 
 <italic>Anethum sowa</italic> L. (Bengali-Shulfa) belonging to the family 
 <italic>Apiaceae</italic> (
 <italic>Umbelliferae</italic>), comes under genus 
 <italic>Anethum</italic> and it is an annual and winter spice crop in Bangladesh. It is mostly grown in the northern part of Bangladesh. A variant called Indian dill or sowa (
 <italic>Anethum sowa</italic> Roxb.) is largely cultivated in Bangladesh, India, Egypt and Japan. Indigenous people consume it as a spice for a flavouring agent in food preparation. The herb grows ordinarily 2–2.5 ft. in height with small feathery leaves, tapped and branched roots [

 <italic>Anethum graveolens</italic> L.) and Indian dill (
 <italic>Anethum sowa</italic> L.) are differentiated mainly by the apiol and carvone content. 
 <italic>Anethum sowa</italic> is rich in apiol whereas 
 <italic>Anethum graveolens</italic> is rich in carvone. The typical flavor of dill herb oil is due to α-phellandrene, limonene and dill ether (anethofuran) [
