<p class="p">The ability to scavenge different reactive species makes the HEO an important source of antioxidants that are potentially useful in the detoxification mechanisms of living organism. Primary and relative weak antioxidants (such as O

 <sup class="sup">•−</sup>), in fact, can be the precursor or be combined with others (e.g., nitric oxide) to give rise to very dangerous reactive species (hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, singlet oxygen, peroxynitric radical, and so on). Furthermore, HEO, acting as a strong chelating agent, may reduce the availability of transition metals and inhibit the radical-mediated oxidative chain reactions in biological systems preserving the integrity and consequently the functionality of membranes. As showed in β-carotene bleaching assay (
