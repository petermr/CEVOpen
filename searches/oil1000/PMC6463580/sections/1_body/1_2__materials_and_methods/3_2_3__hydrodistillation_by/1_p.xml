<p class="p">For the extraction of essential oils from rosemary by hydrodistillation under optimal operating conditions, a quantity of 100 g of rosemary was added to 800 ml of distilled water in a 2-liter flask [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The set was placed in a balloon heater attached to a refrigerator to ensure condensation of essential oils for 3 hours. At the end of the distillation, two phases were observed, an aqueous phase (aromatic water) and an organic phase (essential oil), less dense than water. The essential oil was collected, dried under anhydrous sodium sulphate, and stored in sealed vials in the dark, at 4°C, until used. Experiments were conducted twice for each condition.
