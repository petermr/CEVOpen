<p class="p">The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine cytokine expressions. The human astrocytes (4 × 10

The Reverse Transcription System (A&amp;A Biotechnology, Poland) was used for cDNA synthesis according to the instruction of the manufacturer. PCR was carried out using the gene-specific primers for human (

The PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 55–65°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 2 min. PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Further procedures are described in a previous study by Sitarek et al. [
