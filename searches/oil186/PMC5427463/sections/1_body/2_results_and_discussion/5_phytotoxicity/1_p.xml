<p>A series of experiments was conducted to assess the level of toxicity of the SoEO on the seed germination, hypocotyl and root lengths and fresh weights of 
 <italic>T. aestivum</italic>, 
 <italic>R. sativus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic> and 
 <italic>T. foenum-graecum</italic> (Figure 2
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">(Fig. 2)</xref> and 3
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">(Fig. 3)</xref>). The SoEO affected the germination and the seedling growth of tested seeds in a different way. Although the level of the major compounds in the essential oil of 
 <italic>S. officinalis </italic>was closed to those of other
 <italic> Salvia </italic>species, the interaction between seed species and treatments (with or without SoEO) was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01). The SoEO did not statistically inhibit the germination of all tested seeds (Figure 2
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">(Fig. 2)</xref>).
