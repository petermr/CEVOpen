<p>To our knowledge, there are few reports on essential oil compounds of 
 <italic>Kundmannia</italic> species (Djarri et al., 2008; Faidi et al., 2014; Paksoy et al., 2016). Essential oil compositions of 
 <italic>K. sicula</italic> from Algerian were analyzed previously by Djarri et al (2008) and those from Tunisian by Faidi et al (2014). Essential oil compositions and antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>K. syriaca</italic> and 
 <italic>K. anatolica</italic> from Turkey have been reported for the first time by Paksoy et al (2016). However, Paksoy et al (2016) identified the essential oil constituents from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>K. anatolica</italic> and reported that spathulenol (17.4%), curdione (4.6%), apritone (4.4%) and germacrene-d (4.5%) were the major components. Faidi et al (2014) reported that the major compounds of essential oils from the inflorescences with mature seeds of 
 <italic>K. Sicula</italic> growing in Tunisia were identified as isocurcumenol (10.1%), hexadecanoic acid (10.9%), spathulenol (3.4%), 10-epi-geudesmol (.5%), a-cubebene (6.1%) and trans-dihydro occidentalol (6.6%).
