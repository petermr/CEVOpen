<p class="p">In the
 <italic class="italic"> R. carthamoides</italic> SGR and HR essential oils studied in this report, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons dominated, 54.7 and 62.2%, respectively. The sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were also the major group of the components in
 <italic class="italic"> R. carthamoides</italic> essential oil obtained by Havlik et al. [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. In contrast, Geszprych and Weglarz [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] found that oils from the roots and rhizomes of this species growing in Poland were abundant in monoterpenes. The SGR and HR essential oils in the present study were poor in both hydrocarbons (0.7–1.6%) and oxygenated (0–2.1%) compounds.
