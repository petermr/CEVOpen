 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The vascular tone was measured by referring to previously described procedure [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" href="#CR52">52</a>]. Wistar rats weighting 200-300 g were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (0.1 ml/100 g body weight). The thoracic aorta was quickly and gently removed, cleaned of adherent connective tissue and cut into rings (3-4 mm in length). Rings were gently introduced between two stainless-steel hooks and placed in organ chamber (emka technologies, Paris) containing 11 ml of Krebs solution gassed with 95% O
  <sub>2</sub> and 5% CO
  <sub>2</sub> and maintained at 37 °C and pH 7.4. One hook was connected to an isometric force transducer (emka technologies, Paris) and a tension of 1 g was applied to the vessels then they were allowed to stabilize for 30 min. The composition of Krebs solution was as follows (mmol/L): NaCl 119, KCl 4.7, CaCl
  <sub>2</sub> 2.6, MgSO
  <sub>4</sub> 1.2, KH
  <sub>2</sub>PO
  <sub>4</sub> 1.2, NaHCO
  <sub>3</sub> 25, and Glucose 11. Endothelial integrity was monitored by the percentage of relaxation evoked by carbachol (10
  <span class="sup">−4</span> M) after a steady contraction was reached with phenylephrine (10
  <span class="sup">−6</span> M). Rings with carbachol-induced relaxation less than 50% were discarded. AcEO was dissolved in final concentration of 0.5% DMSO. Control experiments showed that DMSO at 0.5% had no significant effect on the vascular tone.
