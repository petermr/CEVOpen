<p class="p">The oils mechanism of action about antimicrobial effect is acting directly on the bacterial cell wall structure, denaturing and coagulating proteins. Specifically, they act by altering the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane by hydrogen ions (H
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>) and potassium (K
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>). The amendment of the ion concentration gradients leads to deterioration of the essential processes of cell, such as transport of electrons, translocation proteins, stages of oxidative phosphorylation, and other reactions dependent enzymes, resulting in loss of chemiosmotic control of the affected cell, leading to cell death [
