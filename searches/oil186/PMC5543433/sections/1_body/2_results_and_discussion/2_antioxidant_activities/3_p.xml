<p id="Par45">The antioxidant activity may be ascribed to the presence of the same chemical components. Monoterpenes found in this essential oil may act as radical scavenging agents. It seems to be a general trend that the essential oils which contain monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes and/or sesquiterpenes have greater antioxidative properties [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. These activities may be attributed to the presence of 1,8-cineol, α-pinene, β-pinene and limonene found in

Essential oils are quite complex mixtures constituted by several tens of components, and this complexity makes it often difficult to explain the activity pattern. For this reason, many reports on the antioxidant potentials of the essential oils often refer to concepts such as synergism, antagonism and additivity.
