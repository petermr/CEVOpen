<p>As observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, the bacterial number and fluorescence intensity of the essential oil-treated 
 <italic>S. yphimurium</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells increased dramatically with incubation time and concentrations of essential oil. Taken together, these results confirmed the inhibiting capacity of essential oil on the growth rate of surviving 
 <italic>S. yphimurium</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and also suggested that incubation time and concentration presented significant inhibitory effects on the growth of tested bacterial strains.
