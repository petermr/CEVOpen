<p class="p">The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of HR and SGR essential oils was evaluated by means of the twofold serial microdilution assay [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The essential oils dissolved in DMSO were diluted at concentrations ranging from 500 to 0.48 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL, with Mueller-Hinton broth medium for bacteria and 5000 to 4.88 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL with Sabouraud medium for yeasts. The antimicrobial activity of the solvent DMSO was also evaluated. Vancomycin (for Gram-positive bacteria), norfloxacin (for Gram-negative bacteria), and amphotericin B (for yeasts) were used as controls. The MIC values, presented in 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>g/mL, were considered as the lowest concentration of the essential oils that inhibited the growth of the microorganisms, after 24 h of incubation at 37°C. The microbial growth was measured with an Absorbance Microplate Reader set to 620 nm (Thermo Scientific Multiskan FC). Assays for each tested microorganism were carried out in triplicate.
