<p class="p">There are several reports on the analysis of 
 <italic class="italic">O. decumbens</italic> essential oil obtained from diverse geographic regions. Consistent with our results, most previous reports indicate thymol and carvacrol ­­­­as major constituents of the essential oil (3,24), whereas γ-terpinene and myristicin were identified as major compounds of 
 <italic class="italic">O. decumbens</italic> oil collected from Charmahale va Bakhtiary province, Iran (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>). In contrast to our data, no carvacrol was found in 
 <italic class="italic">O. decumbens</italic> essential oil collected from Lorestan province, Iran (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>). This shows that differences in essential oil composition can be due to many factors such as variety of tested plant parts, geographic region and collection time of the plant.
