<p>The HR essential oil was characterized by the high quantities of cyperene (18.2%), 13-norcypera-1(5,11(12)-diene (15.3%), and cadalene (7.2%) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). The concentrations of these components were significantly higher (7-, 11-, and 12-fold, resp.) than those in the SGR essential oil (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, the other major constituent of HR essential oil was 2,5,8-trimethyl-1-naphthol (9.6%) which was identified on the basis of MS (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>); however, this compound has not yet been found in nature and was probably an artifact. The major compounds identified in SGR essential oil such as nardosina-1(10),11-diene and dauca-4(11),8-diene, petasitene, and
