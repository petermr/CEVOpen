<p class="p">Apiol is the major component of the essential oil and it has contained two methoxy groups in the symmetrical position of the benzene ring. This methoxy (−OCH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) group is a well-known strong electron donating group, which can increase the stability of the benzene ring and enhance the radical scavenging activity as a result [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>] and Elisia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>] indicated that the antioxidant activity of apiol is much stronger than the myristicin. It was also reported that substitution on the indole benzene ring with a methoxy group had greatly enhanced the radical scavenging activity of the un-substituted compounds [
