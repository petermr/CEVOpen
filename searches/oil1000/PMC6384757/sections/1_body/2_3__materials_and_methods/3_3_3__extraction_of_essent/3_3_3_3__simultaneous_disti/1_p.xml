<p class="p">Simultaneous distillation-extraction of 
 <italic class="italic">A. argyi</italic> essential oil was performed with a specially designed equipment (shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00483-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>). Ground 
 <italic class="italic">A. argyi</italic> sample (100 g) was loaded into the flask (extraction agent, No. 2) with 1500 mL deionized water, and coupled with another flask (No. 9) which contained 30 mL hexane. The operating temperatures of thermostats No. 1 and 10 were set at 100 °C and 45 °C respectively. The extraction system was performed for 3 h. Afterwards, the valve (No. 8) was turned on, and the continuously condensed distillate was collected in the receiver (No. 11). The essential oil and hexane were separated by a rotary evaporator. Subsequently, the extract was weighed and stored at 4 °C. On the basis of the reported method [
