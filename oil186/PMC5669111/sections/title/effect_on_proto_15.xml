 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate scolicidal effects, various concentrations of the essential oil were evaluated during 5, 10, 20, and 30 min. Initially, 0.5 mL of the protoscoleces (2 × 10
  <span class="sup">3</span>/mL) solution was poured in each test tube. Then, 0.5 mL of different concentrations of the essential oil was added to test tubes. The tubes were mixed gently and then incubated at 37°C for 5, 10, 20, and 30 min. After incubation, 50 μL of 0.1% eosin stain was added to the remaining settled protoscoleces and mixed gently again. After 10 min of incubation, the upper portion of the solution was discarded. The remaining pellet of protoscoleces was then smeared on a glass slide and examined under a light microscope. The mortality rate of the protoscoleces was determined by counting 300 protoscoleces.[
