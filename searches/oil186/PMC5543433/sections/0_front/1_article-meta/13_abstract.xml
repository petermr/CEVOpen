  <title>Background</title>
  <p id="Par1">Lemon (
   <italic>Citrus limon</italic>) is a flowing plant belonging to the 
   <italic>Rutaceae</italic> family. 
   <italic>Citrus</italic> plants constitute one of the main valuable sources of essential oil used in foods and medicinal purposes.

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2">In this study, we assessed chemical composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of 
   <italic>C. limon</italic> essential oil (
   <italic>Cl</italic>EO) with its preservative effect against 
   <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> inoculated in minced beef meat. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify the major components of the obtained 
   <italic>Cl</italic>EO. The antioxidant activities of this 
   <italic>Cl</italic>EO were determined according to the β-carotene bleaching assay, as well as by 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. For antimicrobial activity, agar well diffusion method was used and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) as well as the minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were determined. The in situ effect of the 
   <italic>Cl</italic>EO was evaluated through physicochemical parameters (pH and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), as well as against 
   <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in minced beef meat model.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par3">Twenty one components were identified in the 
   <italic>Cl</italic>EO and the two dominant compounds were limonene (39.74%) and β-Pinene (25.44%). This 
   <italic>Cl</italic>EO displayed an excellent DPPH scavenging ability with an extract concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC
   <sub>50</sub>) of 15.056 μg/ml and a strong β-carotene bleaching inhibition after 120 min of incubation with an IC
   <sub>50</sub> of 40.147 μg/ml. The MICs varied from 0.039 to 1.25 mg/ml for Gram positive bacteria and from 0.25 to 2.5 mg/ml for Gram-negative bacteria. The meat preserving potential of 
   <italic>Cl</italic>EO was investigated against 
   <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. 
   <italic>Cl</italic>EO successfully inhibited development of 
   <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in minced beef meat. The application of 
   <italic>Cl</italic>EO at a 0.06 and 0.312 mg/g, may open new promising opportunities for the prevention of contamination from and growth of pathogenic bacteria, particularly 
   <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, during minced beef meat storage at 4 °C. Additionally, during storage period, physicochemical values (pH and TBARS) were higher in control meat than treated meat with 
   <italic>Cl</italic>EO suggesting an efficient antioxidant activity of 
   <italic>Cl</italic>EO.
  </p>

 <sec>
  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p id="Par4">It was suggested that the 
   <italic>Cl</italic>EO may be a new potential source as natural antimicrobial and antioxidant agents applied in food systems and pharmaceutical industry.
