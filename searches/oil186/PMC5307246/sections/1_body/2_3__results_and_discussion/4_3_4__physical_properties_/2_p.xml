<p>The iodine value of 60.72 g of I
 <sub>2</sub>/100 g of oil was in the range of that of
 <italic> Moringa oleifera</italic> Lam. oil (65.90 g of I
 <sub>2</sub>/100 g) and lower than those of olive, cotton, groundnut, and sunflower oils, which ranged from 86 to 145 g of I
 <sub>2</sub>/100 g of oil [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The relatively low iodine value implies low nutritional value, but high oxidative stability. The oxidative susceptibility of
 <italic> L. kerstingii</italic> seed oil was assessed by the determination of peroxide,
 <italic> p</italic>-anisidine values, and the oxidative stability index.
