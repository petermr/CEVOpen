 <xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] observed modifications to the conductivity values of the emulsions before seeing the instabilities of the systems. The studies by Abdullah, Abdulkarim[
 <xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>] and Mahmood and Akhtar[
 <xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] attributed the continuous increase of conductivity values to the process of coalescence of the internal phase. This was followed by a reduction, which may be attributed to phase separation. Nevertheless, F1 and F2 presented an increase in conductivity during all the experiment, and they were the only formulations that did not have a decrease in conductivity during the period of 180 days [
