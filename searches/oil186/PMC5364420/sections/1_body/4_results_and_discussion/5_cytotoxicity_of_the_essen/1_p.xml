<p>The rhizome of 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> has been reported to have the neuroprotective role

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. In view of this, SH-SY5Y cells were selected to investigate the cytotoxicity of essential oil from 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> rhizomes. The relationship between concentration of essential oil and their cytotoxic effect on SH-SY5Y cells was investigated by MTT and LDH release assays. Compared with untreated control cells, no significant change in the viability of SH-SY5Y cells was found when the concentration at 50–150 μg/mL. However, a significant decrease in cell viability and LDH leakage was observed above 150 μg/mL

 <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the ethyl acetate extracts of 
 <italic>Cyperus rotundus</italic> suppressed growth and proliferation of L1210 cells derived from murine lymphoblastic leukaemia by MTT assay

 <italic>et al</italic>. also reported the cytotoxic activities of 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> extracts in cell culture SH-SY5Y cells
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Kilani 
 <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that 
 <italic>Cyperus rotundus</italic> essential oil from Tunisia was very effective against L1210 leukaemia cells line by MTT assay
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. These results supported the present study. The MTT assay determines cytotoxicity based on the mitochondrial damage of the cells, while LDH assay determines the cytotoxicity based on the plasma membrane damage of the cells. The present study indicated that 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> essential oil had a higher cytotoxic effect on SH-SY5Y cells and the cytotoxic effect increased with a higher dosage in a certain concentration range. The cytotoxic activity of 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> essential oil may be attributed to the presence of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated sesquiterpenes and monterpenens. Besides, the presence of antioxidants in the active 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> may play some roles in reducing cell number because reactive oxygen radicals play an important role in carcinogenesis
