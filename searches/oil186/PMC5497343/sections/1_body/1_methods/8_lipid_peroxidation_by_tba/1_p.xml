 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>] was adapted to measure the inhibitory effect of the essential oil on lipid peroxidation using egg yolk homogenates as lipid rich source. A volume of 125 μL of 10% of the egg homogenate (in distilled water) was added to various concentrations ranged from 0.03–0.5 mg/mL of the plant extract prepared in methanol. The volume was adjusted to 250 μL with distilled water. Afterward, 12.5 μL of FeSO

Then, 0.80% of 2-thiobarbituric acid (375 μL) mixed with sodium dodecyl sulphate 1.1% and 2% trichloroacetic acid (12.5 μL) was added in the same micro centrifuge tubes, vortexed and heat at 65 °C for 60 min. After cooling, 975 μL of butanol was added, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 600 s. The upper organic layer was then aspirated and the absorbance read at 532 nm. Percentage inhibition of lipid by the EO was calculated using the formula previously stated above and all the assays were performed in triplicate.
