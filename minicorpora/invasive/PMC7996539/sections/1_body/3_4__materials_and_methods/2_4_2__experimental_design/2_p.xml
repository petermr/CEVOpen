<p>Initial seedling growth was measured as length in cm and fresh mass in mg 7 days after germination of each individual seedling. Further development was assessed as growth in length (cm) and fresh weight (mg) per day after transfer of the seedlings in soil:vermiculite mixture (3:1) in individual pots (nonparasitic species) or on pregrown 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants to serve as hosts (
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> spp.) 10 days after transfer (nonparasitic species) or after formation of a secondary stem (
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> spp.). Plants were grown in greenhouse conditions at 22 °C, 70% relative humidity and 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod.
