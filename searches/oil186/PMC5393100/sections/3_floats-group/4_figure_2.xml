  <p class="p">Histological changes in rats with choline-deficient diet - induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: (a) Normal group (sham): Liver sinusoid and hepatocytes are normal. (b) Vehicle-treated group: Severe vacuolar degeneration and hepatocyte swelling are observable. (c) Positive control: Some sinusoids are swelled but cellular damage is repaired in comparison to vehicle-treated animals. (d) 
   <italic class="italic">Pimpinella anisum</italic> extract 200 mg/kg: Macrovesicular steatohepatitis is decreased and the microscopic view is similar to sham. (e) 
   <italic class="italic">Pimpinella anisum</italic> extract 100 mg/kg: Some hepatocytes are swelled but no necrosis is observable. (f) 
   <italic class="italic">Pimpinella anisum</italic> essential oil 0.5 mg/kg: Vacuolar degeneration is remarkably decreased in comparison to vehicle-treated group
