 <italic>T. molitor</italic> is controlled primarily with chemical insecticides, but this method has restrictions against stored product insects
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, due to residual toxicity and insect resistance
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, especially in countries with extensive cereal production for export and domestic consumption

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Chemical control of this insect can be achieved by methyl bromide and phosphine treatment; however, fumigants cannot kill the eggs of storage pests and several issues have been discussed in the employment of insecticides, such as residue, environment impact and toxicity to humans

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Economic, social and environmental concerns have caused a gradual change to reduce chemical control in starches and stored products
