<p>Water distillation is used to extract essential oil. The modeling of the extraction process is in principle complex but can be simplified by the judicious choice of the factors to be studied. We selected three factors: the extraction duration (hr), X
 <sub>1</sub>; the residual water content, X
 <sub>2</sub>; and the state of division (cm), X
 <sub>3</sub>.
