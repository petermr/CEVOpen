<p>Other studies of Sartoratto et al. [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] showed that the essential oils obtained from the dried leaves of the species
 <italic> M. piperita</italic> have the major compound linalool (51.0%) in its chemical constitution. The results are in agreement with previous studies of
 <italic> M. piperita</italic> essential oil collected in Brazil, characterizing linalool (51.8%) as the most important major component. However, several studies of the chemical composition found that, in other countries, menthol is the major component. The diversity of chemical compounds in the essential oil of the species is attributed to soil factors, biosynthetic, and collection time [
