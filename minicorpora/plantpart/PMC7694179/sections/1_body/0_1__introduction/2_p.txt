0: The National Pesticide Information Center defines insecticides as pesticides that are formulated to kill, harm, repel or mitigate one or more species of insect ( http://npic.orst.edu/ingred/ptype/insecticide.html).
1: Based on these criteria, four types of insecticides are used in fire ant management, including slow-acting stomach poisons which contain metabolic inhibitors or insect growth regulators, fast-acting contact poisons, repellants, and fumigants.
2: Slow-acting stomach poisons are used in bait products and contact poisons in spray, broadcast, drench, or dust formulations for area and direct nest treatment.
3: Repellants can be useful to exclude ants from some sensitive areas, such as electrical equipment and in hospitals and schools, where synthetic insecticides may be not desired.
4: Fumigants can be useful not only in nest treatment, but also potentially in quarantine treatments, such as disinfesting fire ants from commercial shipping containers.
5: Here we review the current status of chemical control in fire ants, available alternatives to synthetic insecticides, and compounds/materials that recently have been tested for their toxicity and repellency against fire ants.
