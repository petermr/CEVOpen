<p class="p"> The sample containing 5% flaxseed oil had the highest PV at the early stages of storage but during storage, it was more stable and oxidized less (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). This is related to the high amount of olive oil and low amount of flaxseed oil in the first treatment. Olive oil had high PV but it is stable and does not oxidize as fast as flaxseed oil.
