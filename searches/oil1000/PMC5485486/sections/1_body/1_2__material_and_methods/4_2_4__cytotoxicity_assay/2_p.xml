 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l of medium was carefully aspirated from each well and replaced with 20 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l of MTT solution (5 mg/ml of PBS). After incubation in the same conditions for 4 hours, the plates were treated with 80 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>l of an HCl/isopropanol (24 : 1) solution to dissolve the blue intracellular formazan produced by living cells. One hour later, the absorbance (optical density OD) of the plates was determined by a Multiskan EX spectrophotometer reader at two wavelengths (540 and 630 nm). DMSO (0.5%) was used as the negative control and methotrexate (MTX) as the positive one.
