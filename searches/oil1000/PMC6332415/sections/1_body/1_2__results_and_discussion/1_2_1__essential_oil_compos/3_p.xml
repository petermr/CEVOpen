<p class="p">In Tunisia, the only study on the chemical composition of 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> essential oil harvested from Sfax (the south of the country) reported that the essential oil was characterized by 92.18% oxygenated monoterpenes, 2.74% monoterpene hydrocarbons, and 3.1% sesquiterpenes [

 <sc class="sc">l</sc>-menthone (32.74%), pulegone (26.67%), 1,8-cineole (11.16%), and menthol (11.42%). In 
 <italic class="italic">M. spicata</italic> essential oil harvested from four Turkish provinces, with different climatic factors and soil mixture, limonene (3.2%–5.21%) and β-phellandrene (1.31%–2.55%) were the major monoterpene hydrocarbons; 
 <italic class="italic">trans</italic>-caryophyllene (5.23%–8.01%) and germacrene D (3.08%–5.32%) were the major sesquiterpenes [
