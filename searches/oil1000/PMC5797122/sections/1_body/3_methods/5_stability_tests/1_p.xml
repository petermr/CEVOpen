<p id="Par26" class="p">For the light stability tests we exposed the samples to a UV-A lamp (Spectroline EA-160), while for the heat stability we placed the samples in an oven at 60 ± 3 °C. In the combined light and heat stability tests we placed the oil containing vials at the bottom of a thermic bath (ISOTEMP 205) at 60 ± 3 °C surmounted with the UV-A lamp.</p>
