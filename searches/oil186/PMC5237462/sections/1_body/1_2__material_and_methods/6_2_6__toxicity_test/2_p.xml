<p class="p">The solution was prepared to contain 62.5 mg of essential oil, 28 mL of synthetic sea salt solution, and 2 mL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to facilitate its solubilization. Subsequently, at the end of the period in the dark, they were selected and divided into 7 groups of 10 subjects in each test tube. Each group has added a solution of the rate (3125, 2500, 1250, 625, 250, 25, and 2.5
