 <p> Biosynthetic pathway engineered for the production of (+)-zizaene in E. coli by the expression of the native methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, the heterologous MEV pathway and the (+)-zizaene pathway. Heterologous expressed enzymes highlighted in blue. The MEP pathway comprise the following enzymes: 1-Deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase ( Dxs), 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase ( Dxr), MEP cytidyl transferase ( MCT), cytidyl MEP kinase ( CMK), MEP-2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase ( MDS), (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate synthase ( HDS), and (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase ( HDR). The MEV heterologous pathway consisted of the following enzymes: acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase ( AtoB), HMG-CoA synthase (HMGS), truncated HMG-CoA reductase ( tHMGR), mevalonate kinase (MK), phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK), mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (PMD), and isoprenyl diphosphate isomerase ( Idi). The (+)-zizaene pathway comprises the farnesyl diphosphate synthase ( IspA) and the zizaene synthase ( ZS). </p>
