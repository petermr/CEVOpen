<p class="p">The essential oil was analyzed using an Agilent gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). A 30 m DB-5 capillary column was used with helium at a flow rate of 1 mL/minute as the carrier gas. The column temperature program was as follows: 5 min isothermal at 50 °C, increased to 280 °C at a rate of 3 °C min
