 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Defrosted plasma was mixed with 50 mM phosphate buffer containing 0.167 mg/ml o-dianisidine hydrochloride and 0.0005% H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub>. Absorbance of the mixture was measured at 460 nm for 3 min using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (GBC, Cintra 40). One unit of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was equal to the change in absorbance per min at room temperature in the final reaction.[
