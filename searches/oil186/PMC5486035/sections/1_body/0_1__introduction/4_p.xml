<p>In Italy, pistachio crops are typically Sicilian, mainly grown in the territory of Bronte (CT), situated on the eastern part of Sicily and characterized by lava-rich soils and very particular climatic conditions [

 <xref rid="B22-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] which confer to the pistachio nuts superior organoleptic and nutritional characteristics. For this reason, the European Union recognized the variety Bronte as a D.O.P. (Protected Designation of Origin) product. Pistachio nuts are considered a rich source of many important biofunctional compounds that are useful for the human diet and known for their various pharmacological properties such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, insecticidal, and anti-nociceptive activities [

 <xref rid="B24-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These studies managed to identify this matrix as a promising source of healthy compounds. The results obtained highlighted antioxidant and cytoprotective properties directly correlated to the high total phenol content, in particular flavonols, phenolic acid, and flavan-3-ols and, among anthocyanins, to the high content of cyanidyn-3-
