This study focuses on developing antimicrobial wound dressings coated with silver nanoparticles, sodium alginate and different essential oils, to avoid wound infection and biofilm formation. The design of the wound dressings was done by the dip coating method. The characteristics of the developed materials were analysed by physicochemical (FT-IR, XRD, SEM, TEM) and biological (antimicrobial tests) approaches. The results demonstrated uniform silver nanoparticle formation on the substrate, and the developed nanomodified dressings were proven to have increased antimicrobial and antibiofilm potential. The developed wound dressings based on silver nanoparticles, sodium alginate and essential oils have real potential in treating infections, and can be investigated as an efficient alternative to antibiotics and topical preparations for wound management.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dip coating</kwd><kwd>silver nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>essential oils</kwd><kwd>antimicrobial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-materials-13-01682"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Infection represents one of the main risk factors in wound healing. When the skin function based on the barrier activity against bacterial invasion is lost, a large amount of exudate emerges at the affected site, which, together with the body temperature, provides an ideal place for bacterial growth. [<xref rid="B1-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The most common Gram-positive bacteria that can appear at wound sites is <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, which can cause a wide range of infections. These bacteria can lead to significant infections, from the localized affected skin to life-threatening circumstances such as bacteraemia and even pneumonia. Another concern refers to the ability of this opportunistic pathogen to cause hospital-acquired and antibiotic-resistant infections. In many countries, the management of Methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) represents a difficult task in health care facilities [<xref rid="B7-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Along with <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> species, Gram-negative bacteria (such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>), but also yeasts (ex. <italic>Candida albicans</italic>) could colonize wounds and produce persistent infections [<xref rid="B12-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A major concern in infected wounds is the formation of biofilms, which are multicellular communities of microbial species that manifest particular behaviour and increased tolerance to high amounts of antimicrobial drugs and also to the host&#x02019;s immune response [<xref rid="B13-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Recently, there has been an increased interest in developing innovative wound dressings which are able to facilitate healing and avoid wound infection [<xref rid="B12-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B14-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Biopolymers, i.e., naturally occurring proteins and polysaccharides with architectural resemblance to organic tissue obtained through appropriate processing (e.g., nanofibers, spongelike hydrogels, composites etc.), were successfully integrated into the design of dressings and coatings. Several functional biomaterials were identified and implemented for promising wound healing applications, with a reduced impact on the environment [<xref rid="B15-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Sodium alginate is a natural polymer which can be found in the field of wound healing. Numerous biomedical applications are currently investigating this polymer for the development of controlled release drug delivery systems, as an extracellular matrix material for biological studies and scaffolds for tissue engineering in general. However, sodium alginate also has some drawbacks depending on its application, as compared to synthetic polymers, such as low thermal stability, high hydrophilicity and poor mechanical properties. In this respect, studies have led to the development of composite materials with alginate and other materials intended to improve the properties of this polymer [<xref rid="B16-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, the field of nanostructured materials technology has been the object of major interest among scientists, since different types of metallic (gold, silver) or oxide (copper, zinc, titanium, magnesium) nanomaterials have attractive properties and functionalities. Silver nanoparticles have been shown to be very efficient in the development of bioactive dressings with applications in anti-infectious therapy [<xref rid="B19-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], due to their demonstrated antimicrobial effect against bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms [<xref rid="B21-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Due to their low toxicity to human cells, silver nanoparticles are suitable candidates for use as antibacterial agents in wound dressings [<xref rid="B22-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. </p><p>Essential oils (EOs) are obtained from plants (flowers, leaves, roots, buds or bark) as oily extracts using methods such as extraction, fermentation or steam distillation. Some EOs are known to contain natural antimicrobial compounds due to their strong antimicrobial and antioxidant characteristics [<xref rid="B24-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In this study, we selected three of the most actively antimicrobial (i.e., clove EO is active against numerous Gram-positive, Gram-negative and fungi strains [<xref rid="B26-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]) and widely used bioactive EOs (i.e., niaouli and mandarin EOs are used in the cosmetic, pharmaceutic and food industries [<xref rid="B28-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]). Mandarin oil is mostly used in skin treatment because it has a role in reducing fluid retention and stimulating skin circulation, and may reduce the appearance of scars and wrinkles [<xref rid="B30-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Niaouli oil is also known for its strong antibacterial effect. This oil stimulates the immune system by increasing the white blood cell count and antibodies leading to it being known as an effective immunostimulant essential oil [<xref rid="B32-materials-13-01682" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Clove oil possesses special antimicrobial properties.

Finally, the wound dressings were removed from the sodium alginate solution and deposited on a glass support to dry.</p><p>The solutions functionalized with essential oils were obtained using the same method, with the only difference being that in the reductant solution, we added 500 &#x000b5;L of each of the three essential oils.

Antimicrobial Evaluation</title><p>Antimicrobial tests were performed in vitro by using three clinically relevant and model microbial species: Gram-negative (<italic>Escherichia coli ATCC 25922</italic>, Gram-positive: <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 23235 and the yeast strain <italic>Candida albicans ATCC 10231</italic>. The antimicrobial properties of the developed materials were analysed by qualitative (i.e., evaluation of growth inhibition zone) and quantitative methods (i.e., growth of planktonic and attached cultures). For the evaluation of growth, the inhibition zone fragments (1 cm &#x000d7; 1 cm) of the developed materials were sterilized by UV exposure for 30 min. Sterile materials (from each sample) were aseptically placed on nutritive agar plates previously inoculated with 0.5 McFarland (1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> colony forming units/mL) microbial suspensions prepared from the tested microbial strains. The inoculation of microbial strains was performed according to the disc-diffusion antibiogram assay using a sterile swab. The inoculated Petri dishes containing the tested materials were incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C for 24 h to allow microbial development. After incubation, growth inhibition was evaluated. After the incubation time, the growth inhibition zone developed around and under the materials was measured.</p><p>To assess the impact of the coatings on microbial growth in both free-floating (planktonic) and attached cultures, selected microbial strains were grown in nutritive broth in the presence of the coatings. One fragment of sterile material from each sample was placed in a six-well sterile plate. Then, 2 mL of nutritive broth was added into the plates and they were inoculated with 20 &#x003bc;L each of the prepared microbial 0.5 McFarland suspensions. These plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 &#x000b0;C to allow microbial growth and biofilm formation. After incubation, the absorbance of planktonic cultures developed in the presence of the coatings was measured using a spectrophotometer at a set absorbance of 600 nm.</p><p>In order to assess the ability of the microbial cells to attach and develop biofilms after 24 h of incubation, the wound dressings from the previously prepared six-well plates were washed with sterile saline water and introduced in sterile Eppendorf tubes in 1 mL sterile saline water. The washed coatings containing attached cells were further vigorously vortexed to detach the attached cells, and then the resulting suspensions were diluted and inoculated on agar plates to perform viable count analysis and calculate colony forming units (CFU)/mL values. Statistical significance was analysed by Student&#x02019;s T-test.

The use of natural compounds and materials such as alginate and essential oils (mandarin, clove and niaouli) together with silver NPs have permitted the development of improved wound dressings which could be efficiently utilized for the management of wounds, by avoiding infection without the use of antibiotics and antiseptic topic products. </p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, B.S.V. and A.C.B.; methodology, M.C.M.; formal analysis, B.S.V., A.M.H., A.C.B.; investigation, A.M.H.; writing&#x02014;original draft preparation, A.C.B., A.M.H., M.C.M.; All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.</p></notes><notes><title>Funding</title><p>This research received no external funding.</p></notes><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1-materials-13-01682"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Weller</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Team</surname><given-names>V.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>4-Interactive dressings and their role in moist wound management</article-title><source>Advanced Textiles for Wound Care</source><edition>2nd ed.</edition><publisher-name>Woodhead Publishing</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Cambridge, UK</publisher-loc><year>2019</year><fpage>105</fpage><lpage>134</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2-materials-13-01682"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Presterl</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Diab-El Schahawi</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lusignani</surname><given-names>L.S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Paula</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Reilly</surname><given-names>J.S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Basic Principles and Introduction to Disinfectants and Antiseptics for Skin, Mucosa, and Wounds</article-title><source>Basic Microbiology and Infection Control for Midwives</source><publisher-name>Springer</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Heidelberg, Germany</publisher-loc><year>2019</year><fpage>51</fpage><lpage>57</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3-materials-13-01682"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>J&#x000e4;rbrink</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ni</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name><surname>S&#x000f6;nnergren</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Schmidtchen</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Pang</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bajpai</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Car</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The humanistic and economic burden of chronic wounds: A protocol for a systematic review</article-title><source>Syst.
