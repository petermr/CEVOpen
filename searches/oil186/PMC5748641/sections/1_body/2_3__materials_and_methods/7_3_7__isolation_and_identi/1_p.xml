<p>The essential oil of 
 <italic>N. dissecta</italic> (5 g) was subjected to column chromatography over a silica gel G60 column, applying an oil/silica weight ratio of 1:200, with a mixture of Hex:AcOEt 90:10 (isocratic elution), obtaining a total of five fractions and affording acorenone B as a pure compound (1.48 g). The identification was performed by spectroscopic techniques such as EI-MS, 
 <sup>1</sup>H, and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR. 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra were acquired using a VARIAN NMR spectrometer (400 MHz for 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 100 MHz for 
 <sup>13</sup>C), tetramethylsilane was used as an internal standard, and chemical shifts are given in δ (ppm).
