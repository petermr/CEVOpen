However, the flower yield and quality of essential oil of <italic>R. damascena</italic> are largely influenced by the pruning practices and balanced supply of plant nutrition. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis whether the pruning system and foliar fertilization of MgSO<sub>4</sub> would influence the flower yield, growth and secondary metabolites profile of <italic>R. damascena</italic>. A field experiment of 10 treatment combinations comprising two pruning systems (complete and partial) and five levels of MgSO<sub>4</sub> (water spray, MgSO<sub>4</sub> @ 5.0g L<sup>-1</sup>, 10.0g L<sup>-1</sup>,15.0g L<sup>-1</sup>, and 20.0g L<sup>-1</sup>) was conducted. The experiment was conducted in randomized block design with factorial arrangement. Overall, the flower yield ranged from 503.66 to 1114.47 g bush<sup>-1</sup>, while oil content varied from 0.039 to 0.046% of the fresh flower. Irrespective of foliar spray, partial pruning produced significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) higher flower yield (893.02 and 503.66 g bush<sup>-1</sup>) compared with complete pruning system in both the years. Regardless of pruning system, the foliar application of MgSO<sub>4</sub> @ 15.0g L<sup>-1</sup> registered about 26&#x02013;38% higher flower yield compared with water spray control. The major constituents of essential oil were citronellol (19.75&#x02013;48.88%), E-geraniol (9.63&#x02013;29.6%), Z-citral (0.07&#x02013;5.97%), nonadecane (6.76&#x02013;22.32%), and heneicosane (2.87&#x02013;10.21%). The principal component analysis revealed that the major hydrocarbons such as nonadecene, nonadecane, and heptadecane are positively and highly correlated with each others. The results suggest that higher yield and quality of <italic>R. damascena</italic> can be achieved through partial pruning system in combination with foliar application MgSO<sub>4</sub> under rainfed acidic conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>partial pruning</kwd><kwd>MgSO<sub>4</sub></kwd><kwd>rainfed acidic conditions</kwd><kwd>secondary metabolite</kwd><kwd>monoterpenoids</kwd><kwd>hydrocarbons</kwd><kwd>essential oil</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="48"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Damask rose (<italic>Rosa damascena</italic> Mill.), a perennial shrub of the Rosaceae family, is widely known for its high-value essential oil content in the flower. Though <italic>R. damascena</italic> is being commercially cultivated in different parts of the world (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Tabaei-Aghdaei et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Pal, 2013</xref>), Bulgaria and Turkey are the main producers of rose essential oil in the World market (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Rusanov et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Among the 200 species of the genus <italic>Rosa, R. damascena</italic> is recognized as the most superior for high-value essential oil, which is extensively used in the flavoring and fragrance industries (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Rusanov et al., 2009</xref>). Besides its application in aromatic industries, some pharmacological effects such as antioxidant, antibacterial and antimicrobial of rose essential oil have been reported (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Ardogan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Achuthan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Basim and Basim, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Ozkan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Kheirabadi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Rakhshandeh et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Although <italic>R. damascena</italic> is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions, the quality of essential oil is mainly controlled by the genotype, time of flower harvesting, harvesting stage, distillation methods, and agronomic factors (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Baydar and Baydar, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Shawl and Adams, 2009</xref>). However, the relative proportions of the major components in the rose oil are the key factor to determine the quality of oil. Because of the low oil content in flower and lack of synthetic substitutes, rose oil is the most expensive essential oil compared with other essential oil in the world markets.</p><p>It has also been reported that the flower yield of <italic>R. damascena</italic> is considerably influenced by the crop-ecology and agronomic practices (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Pal and Singh, 2013</xref>). Pruning is one of the most important agronomic practices for different rose species to increase flower size, quality and color of flower (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Gibson, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Anderson, 1991</xref>). Pruning operation modifies the growth phases and physiological activities for facilitating new axillary bud initiation. In pruned stems, the flower initiation starts shortly after axillary bud development (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Chimonidou et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, pruning operation is carried out to improve the shape of the plant for facilitating cultural operations and harvesting. It has also been reported that the pruning operation promotes photosynthetic light reaction, increases metabolic sinks, and elevates turgor pressure in plants (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Calatayud et al., 2007</xref>). The pruning style also influences the nutrient cycle (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Admasu and Struikb, 2000</xref>). However, roses need different types, level and timing of pruning depending upon their species, variety, and ecological conditions (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hessayon, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Pal et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, there is a pressing need to standardize the pruning system to maintain the rose bushes in a manageable condition for plucking the flower and enhancing production under different agro-climatic conditions.</p><p>In Palampur (western Himalayan region), the rainfall is erratic, and 70&#x02013;80% of the total rain is received during monsoon (June&#x02013;September); but the gentle winter rain is useful for crop productions. Now there is a pressing need for enhancing crop productivity under rainfed conditions. However, the efficiency of plant nutrients applied in the soil is low under rainfed conditions. Moreover, unpredicted rainfall also makes difficult to determine the level and timing of fertilizer application.</p><p>The nutritional factor is equally responsible for determining the flower yield and quality of essential oil of <italic>R damascena</italic>. Among the essential plant nutrients, magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) is one of the important secondary nutrients, which occurs in the center of the chlorophyll molecule and therefore plays a major role in plant photosynthesis (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Hermans et al., 2010</xref>). It has also been reported that even minute differences in Mg may influence the various chloroplast enzymes (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Shaul, 2002</xref>). Nevertheless, the uptake of Mg<sup>2+</sup> by plant is lower than K due to cationic competitive effects. Moreover, the Mg depletion in soil is a growing concern for intensive agriculture, particularly when soil fertilized only with N, P, and K. Mg deficiency is a more serious problem in rainfed acidic soil conditions due to the interaction with aluminum (Al). Thus, nutrient use efficiency (NUE) is very low under this situation. Furthermore, under rainfed conditions, application of nutrient in soil cannot meet the internal demand during critical stages. The foliar application of plant nutrients is an alternative approach to increase the NUE and to meet the internal demand under these conditions. Under nutrient deficiency condition, the foliar application technique ensures instant translocation of nutrients to various plant parts through leaf tissues (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Fageria et al., 2009</xref>). However, the effects of foliar application of Mg and their amount on <italic>R. damascena</italic> have not been studied lucidly under rainfed acidic conditions. The objectives of this study were to investigate the impact of pruning system and foliar application of different concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on the flower yield, essential oil content, and composition of essential oil of <italic>R. damascena</italic> under rainfed acidic soil conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Experimental Location, Climate, and Soil Characteristics</title><p>The field experiment was conducted at the experimental farm of CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (32&#x000b0;06&#x02032;05&#x02033;N; 76&#x000b0;34&#x02032;10&#x02033;E), Palampur, India, during the cropping seasons of 2012&#x02013;2013 and 2013&#x02013;2014.

A basal dose of 100 kg nitrogen (N), 21.85 kg phosphorus (P), and 41.50 kg potassium (K) was applied by urea (46% N), single super phosphate (16% P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), and muriate of potash (60% K<sub>2</sub>O), respectively, during both the cropping seasons. Irrigation was not given during the course of study, since the crop was grown under rain-fed conditions. However, other recommended agronomic practices for <italic>R. damascena</italic> were adopted as per requirement for better growth and development. The experiment was laid out in randomized block design (RBD) with two-factors factorial arrangement and three replications. Ten treatment combinations consisting two different types of pruning [complete pruning (C) and partial pruning (P)] and five different concentrations of MgSO<sub>4</sub> [water spray control (M<sub>0</sub>), MgSO<sub>4</sub> @ 5.0g L<sup>-1</sup> (M<sub>1</sub>), MgSO<sub>4</sub> @ 10.0g L<sup>-1</sup> (M<sub>2</sub>), MgSO<sub>4</sub> @ 15.0g L<sup>-1</sup> (M<sub>3</sub>), and MgSO<sub>4</sub> @ 20.0g L<sup>-1</sup> (M<sub>4</sub>)] were tested. The pruning operation was done during 50th meteorological standard week (MSW) at 90 cm height from the ground level in 2012&#x02013;2013 and 2013&#x02013;2014. In case of partial pruning system, five new shoots were left without pruning in each bush, and the remaining shoots were pruned at 90 cm height from the ground level. The MgSO<sub>4</sub> solutions for different treatments were diluted with water (about 800 L ha<sup>-1</sup>), and sprayed twice; the first foliar spray was applied at axillary bud development stage, and the second spray was done at flower bud appearance stage.</p></sec><sec><title>Growth and Yield Data</title><p>Two plants were randomly selected for each treatment from each replication, and the selected plants were tagged for growth and yield observation. After pruning, number of old shoots (No. bush<sup>-1</sup>) was recorded. New shoot initiation rate (No. old shoot<sup>-1</sup>) was also recorded. The data on number of flowers (No. shoot<sup>-1</sup>), flower weight (g flower<sup>-1</sup>), flower yield (g new shoot<sup>-1</sup> and g bush<sup>-1</sup>) were recorded day-to-day basis from initial date of harvesting to end of the flowering. The flowers were harvested by manual picking in the morning (6:00&#x02013;9:00 AM) to prevent the loss of volatile compounds from the flower.</p></sec><sec><title>Extraction of Essential Oil</title><p>The essential oil was extracted from fresh flowers harvested separately from each plot. The oil was extracted by hydro-distillation for 4 h on a Clevenger-type apparatus using a 5.0 L distillation system. The flower and water ratio was 1:2 (w/v). The essential oil from each plot sample was measured, and the oil content (w/w) in flower was expressed as percentage on a fresh weight basis. The extracted essential oil was dehydrated by anhydrous Na<sub>2</sub> SO<sub>4</sub> (Merck) and collected in a glass vial. The sealed oil samples were stored in a dark place at 4&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>GC&#x02013;MS Analysis and Compound Identification</title><p>The compounds of oil samples were identified by using a Shimadzu QP2010 GC-MS system (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) attached with an AOC-5000 auto injector and a ZB-5 (SGE International, Ringwood, VIC, Australia) fused silica capillary column (30 m &#x000d7; 0.25 mm i.d., and film thickness 0.25 &#x003bc;m). The conditions for analysis were identical to those previously described (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Pal et al., 2014</xref>). The retention indices (RI) for all volatile compounds were computed by using homologous series of n-alkanes (C8&#x02013;C24). Then the constituents of essential oil were identified by comparing their RI and mass spectra with those of authentic samples and with those stored in the NIST-MS (National Institute of Standards and Technology-mass spectral) database (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Stein, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>GC Analysis and Quantification</title><p>All the GC analyses of rose oil samples were carried out by a Shimadzu GC-2010 gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and a ZB-5 capillary column (30 m &#x000d7; 0.25 mm, fused silica, and film thickness 0.25 m). The operating conditions for analysis were identical to those previously described (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Pal et al., 2014</xref>).

Chl was extracted from 200 mg fresh leaf tissue sample for each treatment in the solution of 80% acetone (v/v). The absorbance of the extracts at 645 and 663 nm was recorded with a spectrophotometer (model T 90 + UV/vis, PG Instrument Ltd.). Finally, the total Chl content (mg g<sup>-1</sup> tissue) was calculated based on the absorbance values as per standard equations (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Arnon, 1949</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, the leaves were collected from each experimental unit at the end of the both cropping seasons for the estimation of N, P, and K content in the leaves. After drying, the leaf samples were prepared with a laboratory grinder having a sieve spacing of 0.7 mm. For N estimation, the samples were digested with concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and a catalyst mixture of potassium sulfate and copper sulfate (10:1). Then, Kel Plus nitrogen analyzer unit was used for estimation of total N content in the leaves. In case of P and K estimation, a mixture of concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and perchloric acid (5:1) was used for digestion. Then, a spectrophotometer (model T 90 + UV/vis, PG Instrument Ltd.) and a flame photometer (model BWB XP, BWB technologies UK Ltd., UK) were used for the estimation of total P and K, respectively, as per standard procedure (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Prasad et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The growth and yield data obtained from <italic>R. damascena</italic> for consecutive 2 years were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test the sole effect of pruning system and foliar application of MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and pruning system &#x000d7; MgSO<sub>4</sub> interaction by using Statistica 7 software (Stat Soft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). In this experiment, a two-factor factorial RBD was used with three replications. Differences among the treatment means were assessed by the least significant difference (LSD) value at <italic>P</italic> = 0.05. Correlation matrix was conducted by using Statistica 7 software to investigate relationships between the yield and yield attributes. The regression equation between yield and MgSO<sub>4</sub> doses was also developed using same software. However, the heat maps of chemical profiling of essential oil were prepared with the help of R data analysis software (version 3.1.3). Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to evaluate the influences of treatment combinations on chemical profiling of essential oil as a bi-plot, and nature of variations among the treatment combinations was also projected. The factor loading values represent the correlations of each variable with the principal components (PCs).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Growth and Yield Data</title><p>The analyzed data revealed that two main yield attributes of <italic>R. damascena</italic>, new shoot initiation rate (No. old shoot<sup>-1</sup>) and number of flowers (No. bush<sup>-1</sup>), were significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) influenced by the system of pruning during both the years (<bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref></bold>).

The treatment PM<sub>0</sub> (partial pruning with water spray control) and PM<sub>1</sub> (partial pruning with foliar application of MgSO<sub>4</sub> @ 5.0g L<sup>-1</sup>) were separated by the PC<sub>1</sub> from the rest of the treatments and placed in the negative end of the PC<sub>1</sub> in 2012&#x02013;2013 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref></bold>). These two treatments were separated from each other by PC<sub>2</sub>. In 2013&#x02013;2014, the treatments PM<sub>2</sub> (partial pruning with foliar application of MgSO<sub>4</sub> @ 10.0g L<sup>-1</sup>), PM<sub>3</sub> (partial pruning with foliar application of MgSO<sub>4</sub> @ 15.0g L<sup>-1</sup>), and CM<sub>4</sub> (complete pruning with foliar application of MgSO<sub>4</sub> @ 20.0g L<sup>-1</sup>) were separated from rest of the treatments, and they formed individual group (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref></bold>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The photosynthesis process and synthesis of non-structural carbohydrates are influenced by pruning practices (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Chesney and Vasquez, 2007</xref>), and the non-structural carbohydrates, which are stored in the pruned plant and used for plant regrowth (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Loescher et al., 1990</xref>). In this study, new shoot initiation rate (4.63 and 10.80 No. old shoot<sup>-1</sup>) was significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) higher with partial pruning system compared with the complete system. This result might be due to larger number of dormant vegetative buds present in partially pruned bushes. Moreover, partial pruning maintains a sequence of axes leading from leaves to stem and root system for allocation of photosynthates (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Chesney and Nygren, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Chesney, 2008</xref>). In our earlier research, higher new shoot initiation rate had also been recorded with top pruning system (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Pal et al., 2014</xref>). Irrespective of foliar application of MgSO<sub>4</sub>, partial pruning system registered about 22 and 77% higher number of flowers compared with complete pruning system during 2012&#x02013;2013 and 2013&#x02013;2014, respectively. These results might be due to the fact that the partial pruning increased light interception within its canopy, maintained adequate amount of metabolic sinks and improved stem water potential.</p><p>Though the flower weight (g flower<sup>-1</sup>) was not significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x02265; 0.05) affected by pruning system, the partial pruning system produced significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) higher flower yield compared with complete pruning system, regardless of foliar spray. This result might be attributed to the cumulative effects on higher new shoot initiation rate and number of flower (No. bush<sup>-1</sup>) which ultimately enhanced flower yield. The flower yield is positively correlated with new shoot initiation rate (<italic>r</italic> = 0.74, <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) and number of flower (<italic>r</italic> = 1.00, <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.01) (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>). It had been reported that partial pruning increased relative water content (RWC) and maintained higher photosynthesis process and nutrient supply through root profile (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Saifuddin et al., 2010</xref>). In our experiment, the variations in flower yield over the years were quite noticeable, and higher yield was recorded in first cropping season (<bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref></bold>). These results could be due to the fact that the environmental conditions, particularly temperature and rainfall were not favorable during vegetative growth phase and reproductive stage (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). The maximum and minimum temperature (&#x000b0;C) at flower bud formation and flowering stages in 2013&#x02013;2014 were quite low compared with 2013&#x02013;2014 cropping season (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>). However, the effect of partial pruning system to increase flower yield was more pronounced in second cropping season (<bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref></bold>). The higher flower yield with partial pruning system might be attributed to the higher level of photosynthetic pigment and N content in leaves (<bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref></bold>). Though the overall yield in first cropping season was higher, the yield increased by the foliar application of MgSO<sub>4</sub> @ 15.0g L<sup>-1</sup> was more consistent over the years.</p><p>On the other hand, Mg<sup>2+</sup> plays a major role in plant photosynthesis and improvement of plant health (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Hermans et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, the uptake of Mg<sup>2+</sup> by plant is lower than K, and its deficiency is a more serious problem in rainfed acidic soil conditions due to the interaction with aluminum (Al). In this study, regardless of pruning system, the maximum number of flower (357.50 and 250.67 no. bush<sup>-1</sup>) and flower yield (1114.47 and 830.69 g bush<sup>-1</sup>) were recorded with the foliar application of MgSO<sub>4</sub> @ 15.0g L<sup>-1</sup> during both the cropping seasons. This result may be due to the fact that the foliar application of MgSO<sub>4</sub> under rainfed conditions increases the availability of Mg for formation of photosynthetic pigment and hastens physiological activities for flower buds formation. The effect of Mg on the various chloroplast enzymes has been reported by <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Shaul (2002)</xref>. Furthermore, it had been reported that an adequate supply of Mg increased the activities of antioxidative enzymes and the content of antioxidant molecules in many crops (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cakmak and Marschner, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cakmak, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Candan and Tarhan, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Tewari et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Anza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Waraich et al., 2012</xref>). We also observed the second degree polynomial relationship (y = 721.31 + 25.707 x - 0.894 x<sup>2</sup>; <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.752) between flower yield and level of MgSO<sub>4</sub> doses (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>). In our experiment, total Chl concentration and nitrogen content in the leaves were higher in all MgSO<sub>4</sub> treated plants (<bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref></bold>). This result may be a cause to increase the number of flowers and flower yield in MgSO<sub>4</sub> treated plots in the present study.</p><p>Regardless of foliar spray, the Chl content in leaves was considerably higher with the partial pruning system compared with a complete pruning system during both the years. These results could be due to the fact that partial pruning increased light interception within its canopy and hastened cytokinin activities. On the other hand, foliar application of MgSO<sub>4</sub> also considerably increased the total Chl content in leaves in our study, regardless of pruning system. These results may be due to the fact that the Mg is the central atom of the chlorophyll molecule, hence plays a major role in plant photosynthesis (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Hermans et al., 2010</xref>). It has been reported that various chloroplast enzymes are influenced by the minute differences in Mg level (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Shaul, 2002</xref>). The ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylase, a key enzyme in the photosynthesis process, is an important Mg-activated enzyme (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Cakmak and Yazici, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The concentrations of N and K in the leaves were not influenced by pruning system in 2012&#x02013;2013 cropping season. These results could be due to the dilution effect of nutrient content. However, in 2013&#x02013;2014, the N, P, and K accumulations in leaves were significantly increased (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) with partial pruning system (<bold>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref></bold>). These results could be due to the fact that partial pruning increased the root proliferation, in which root uptakes more nutrients from larger area of greater depth. The results are in conformity with the findings of <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Saifuddin et al. (2010)</xref>. On the other hand, N and P concentrations in leaves were marginally increased with MgSO<sub>4</sub> treated plants compared with water spray control. These results could be due to the fact that the Mg deficiency prevents uptake of mineral nutrients under rainfed acidic soil conditions. Thus, foliar application of Mg is the effective measure to increase the nutrient uptake pattern in these situations.</p><p>The essential oil yield of <italic>R. damascena</italic> is extremely low compared to other essential oil-bearing crops. In our experiment, the average essential oil content in the fresh flower varied from 0.039 to 0.046% depending upon the pruning systems, MgSO<sub>4</sub> doses, and cropping seasons; however, this variation was not significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x02265; 0.05). Among the foliar spray, moderate level of MgSO<sub>4</sub> registered little bit higher oil content. This result may be due to the fact that Mg and its counter ion sulfur influence various biochemical activities. The effects of sulfur to increase the essential oil content have been reported in dragonhead plants (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Aziz et al., 2010</xref>) and basil (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Zheljazkov et al., 2008</xref>). It had also been reported that foliar application of Ca and Mg increased oil yield of <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Dordas, 2009</xref>). The major components of rose essential oil are citronellol, nerol, geraniol, linalool, methyl eugenol, and hydrocarbon, which decide the perfumery value of rose oil (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Baser, 1992</xref>). Though, the least numbers of compounds were identified with PM<sub>0</sub> (partial pruning system with water spray control), the shearing percentage in total volume was quite high. Thus, the numbers of compounds are not responsible for contributing in total volume of rose essential oil.</p><p>In this study, the major components were considerably influenced by the interactive effect of pruning system and foliar application of MgSO<sub>4</sub> in both the years (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref></bold>). The accumulation patterns of different volatiles were very dynamics, with citronellol varying from 19.75 to 48.88%, E-geraniol from 9.63 to 29.68%, Z-citral from 0.07 to 5.97%, nonadecane from 6.76 to 22.32, and heneicosane from 2.87 to 10.21%. Two major monoterpenoids citronellol and E-geraniol, attained its maximum level of accumulation with PM<sub>0</sub> and PM<sub>3</sub>, respectively, in 2012&#x02013;2013 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref></bold>). However, the minimal accumulation of nonadecane was recorded with CM<sub>1</sub> followed by PM<sub>2</sub>. These results may be due to the fact that the pruning system coupled with foliar application of MgSO<sub>4</sub> influences the biosynthesis of various compounds. The influences of foliar application of plant nutrients to change the percentages of major components of essential oils have been reported in many medicinal and aromatic plants such as oregano (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Dordas, 2009</xref>), French tarragon (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Heidari et al., 2014</xref>), and lemongrass (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Zheljazkov et al., 2011</xref>). The multivariate analysis was also conducted by means of PCA for chemical composition. The PCA bi-plots indicated the relation among the variables (<bold>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A,C</xref></bold>). The analyzed data indicates that the compounds <italic>viz.</italic>, &#x003b1;-pinene, &#x003b2;-pinene, myrcene, linalool, phenyl ethyl acetate, and E-geraniol have highly positive coefficient with PC<sub>1</sub> in first cropping season. Thus, these compounds are influenced by the similar factors. On the other hand major hydrocarbons such as nonadecene, nonadecane, and heptadecane are positively and highly correlated with each others. Thus the inverse relationship was found between hydrocarbons and monoterpene.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results reveal that the pruning system and foliar application of MgSO<sub>4</sub> alter the flowering behavior, flower and essential oil yield, and profiling of secondary metabolites of <italic>R. damascena</italic> under rainfed acidic conditions. The partial pruning system produced significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) higher flower yield compared with complete pruning system, regardless of foliar spray. However, the effect of pruning system on flower yield was not consistent over the years. On the other hand, the foliar application of MgSO<sub>4</sub> @ 15.0g L<sup>-1</sup> registered about 26&#x02013;38% higher flower yield compared with water spray control. The effects of partial pruning system and foliar application of MgSO<sub>4</sub> to increase flower yield were more pronounced in second cropping season. Substantial variations in major compounds (citronellol, E-geraniol, Z-citral, nonadecane, and heneicosane) of essential oil were also observed in this experiment. Thus, it can be concluded that the partial pruning system and foliar application of MgSO<sub>4</sub> @ 15.0g L<sup>-1</sup> may be adopted to increase the flower and oil yield with desired quality. However, further studies are required to understand the role of other factors particularly plant nutritions and environmental factors on enzymatic activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>PP: Develop the concept, design the experiment, data analysis, and manuscript writing.
