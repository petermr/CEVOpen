<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">in vitro</italic> antibacterial activity of the tested sample was carried out by disc diffusion method. The inoculum suspension containing 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> CFU/mL of bacteria was spread on nutrient agar medium uniformly. The sample was dissolved and then loaded on 6 mm sterile individual discs. The loaded discs were placed on the surface of medium and the diameter of zone of inhibition (ZOI) was measured after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericide concentration (MBC) of sample were determined according to the method as previously described
