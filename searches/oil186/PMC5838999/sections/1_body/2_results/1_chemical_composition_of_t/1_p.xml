<p id="Par47">The total yield of the volatile fraction obtained from aerial part of 
 <italic>R. acaule</italic> was 0.018% (
 <italic>w</italic>/w). The obtained essential oil was yellow with a pleasant odour. The chemical composition of the essential oil obtained from the aerial part was investigated using both GC and GC/MS techniques. The percentages and the retention indices of the identified oil components were listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> in the order of their elution on the HP-5MS column. As shown in this table, 26 components were identified which represent 97.4% of the total oil. The major constituents were germacrene D (49.2 ± 1.1%), methyl eugenol (8.3 ± 0.28%), 
 <italic>(E)</italic>-β-ionone (6.2 ± 0.18%), β-caryophyllene (5.7 ± 0.17%), 
 <italic>(E,E)</italic>-α-farnesene (4.2 ± 0.1%), bicyclogermacrene (4.1 ± 0.12%) and 
 <italic>(Z)</italic>-α-bisabolene (3.7 ± 0.08%). Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> showed also that the essential oil was characterized by the dominance of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (74.2%).
