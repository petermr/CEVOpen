 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. A volume of 5 μl of essential oil at the concentration of 2 mg/mL was added to 2 μl of pGEM®-Tplasmid DNA (0.5 μg/well). The mixtures were then kept for 10 min at room temperature followed by the addition of 10 μl of Fenton’s reagent (3 mM H2O2, 50 μM L-ascorbic acid and 80 μM FeCl3). The obtained mixtures were then incubated at 37 °C during 5 min. Finally, the DNA incubated with or without essential oil was then analyzed on 1% (
