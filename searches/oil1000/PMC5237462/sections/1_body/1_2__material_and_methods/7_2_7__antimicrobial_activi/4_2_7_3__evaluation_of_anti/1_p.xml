<p class="p">To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of essential oils, we used the disk agar diffusion method. Each bacterial suspension was plated (in triplicate) with the aid of a stereodisposable swab across the surface of Mueller-Hinton agar. A solution was prepared with a solubilized concentration of 250 mg/mL with Tween 80 and then, dilutions were held to obtain concentrations of 100, 50, and 10 mg/mL. After that, it was soaked on filter paper discs (Whatman, type 3) of 6 mm diameter each 10 L concentrations, respectively. After incubation of the plates at 35°C for 24 hours, a reading of the results by measuring the halo formed around disks containing the oil was performed. The result of each dilution, the average of the three measurements, and susceptible halo of an equal size or greater than 8 mm diameter were considered [
