<p>The tea tree essential oil contained both light monoterpenes and numerous sesquiterpenes. The main compound is 4-terpineol, followed by γ-terpinene, 2-carene, α-terpineol, α-terpinene, α-pinene, o-cymene, limonene, β-caryophyllene, eucalyptol, and β-myrcene—
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-10-00045-f004">Figure 4</xref>. Standards ask for α-terpinene (5%–13%), which was not found in our tee tree sample, instead 2-carene was found in high amounts of about 10%. Aromadendrene and δ-cadinene, mentioned by standards in amounts varying from traces up to 7%–8% were confirmed in the studied sample.
