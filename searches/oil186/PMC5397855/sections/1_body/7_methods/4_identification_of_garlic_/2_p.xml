<p>The compounds were identified using a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass detector GC/MS (GCMS-QP 5050 A; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The injector and detector temperatures were 220 °C and 300 °C, respectively. The initial column temperature was 40 °C for 3 min, with a programmed temperature increase of 3 °C/min to 300 °C where it was maintained for 25 min. The split mode ratio was 1:10. One microliter of the garlic essential oil containing 1% (w/v in dichloromethane) was injected, helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate constant of 1.8 mL
 <sup>−1</sup> on the Rtx
 <sup>®</sup>-5MS capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm; Bellefonte, USA) using the Crossbond
 <sup>®</sup> stationary phase (35% diphenyl-65% dimethyl polysiloxane). Mass spectrometer was programmed to detect masses in the range of 29–450 Da with 70 eV ionization energy. Compounds were identified by comparisons of the mass spectra with those available in the NIST08, NIST11 library and Wiley Spectroteca Data Base (7
 <sup>th</sup> edition), and by the Retention indices.
