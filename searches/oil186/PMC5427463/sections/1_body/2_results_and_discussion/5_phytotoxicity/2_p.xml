<p>Our data disagree with the literature on inhibitory activity exerted by essential oils of 
 <italic>Salvia </italic>species on seed germination (Mancini et al., 2009[
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; Muller and Muller, 1964[
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; Singh et al., 2006[
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]). Significant interactions (p &lt; 0.05) between seed species and treatments (with or without SoEo) were also noted in radicle and hypocotyl lengths and weights (Figure 3
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">(Fig. 3)</xref>). Indeed, radicle length and hypocotyl length of 
 <italic>T. aestivum</italic> and 
 <italic>T. foenum-graecum</italic> seeds were significantly inhibited by the SoEO, while stimulation was observed on 
 <italic>S. lycopersicum </italic>and 
 <italic>R. sativus </italic>seeds, in comparison to untreated seeds. Fresh weight of roots and hypocotyls of 
 <italic>T. aestivum</italic> and 
 <italic>T. foenum-graecum</italic> also decreased by the SoEO, compared to the untreated seeds (Figure 3
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">(Fig. 3)</xref>).
