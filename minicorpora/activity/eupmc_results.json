      "<h4>Context</h4><i>Zataria multiflora</i> Boiss (Lamiaceae) essential oil (ZME) is believed to be a bactericide herbal medicine and might alleviate negative effects of infection.<h4>Objective</h4>This study evaluates the effects of an ointment prepared from ZME (ZMEO) on infected wounds.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A full-thickness excisional skin wound was surgically created in each mouse and inoculated with 5 × 10<sup>7</sup> suspension containing <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. The BALB/c mice (<i>n</i> = 72) were divided into four groups: (1) negative control that received base ointment (NCG), (2) positive control that daily received Mupirocin<sup>®</sup> (MG), (3) therapeutic ointment containing 2% ZMEO and (4) therapeutic ointment containing 4% ZMEO, for 21 days. Wound contraction, total bacterial count, histopathological parameters, antioxidant activity, qRT-PCR analysis for expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, VEGF, IGF-1, TGF-β, IL-10, and FGF-2 mRNA levels were assessed on days 3, 7, and 14 following the wounding.<h4>Results</h4>Topical administration of ZMEO significantly decreased the total bacterial count and wound area and also expression of IL-1β and TNF-α compared to the control groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in all days. This could also increase significantly the expression of TGF-β, IL-10 IGF-1, FGF-2, and VEGF, and also angiogenesis, fibroblasts, fibrocytes, epithelialization ratio, and collagen deposition and improve antioxidant status compared to the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.05).<h4>Discussion and conclusion</h4>ZMEO accelerated the healing process of infected wounds by shortening the inflammatory factors and increasing proliferative phase. Applying ZMEO only and/or in combination with chemical agents for the treatment of wound healing could be suggested."

      "<h4>Context</h4>Processing with vinegar could enhance the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of <i>Curcuma phaeocaulis</i> Valeton. (Zingiberaceae), a Chinese herbal medicine with anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities.<h4>Objective</h4>This study investigated the vinegar processing effects by evaluating anti-angiogenic effect and toxicity of <i>C. phaeocaulis</i> through zebrafish and rat models.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Zebrafish embryos (AB and FLk-GFP strain) were applied to evaluate toxicity, cardiotoxicity and anti-angiogenic activity of volatile oil, and water decoction of the raw and vinegar-processed <i>C</i>. <i>phaeocaulis.</i> Meanwhile, a blood stasis syndrome rat model was applied to study the toxicity by measuring the ovarian and uterine coefficient.<h4>Results</h4><i>Curcuma phaeocaulis</i> volatile oil and its vinegar-processed products in zebrafish had an LC<sub>50</sub> of 67.315 and 95.755 μg/mL, respectively. <i>Curcuma phaeocaulis</i> water decoction and its vinegar-processed products had an LC<sub>50</sub> of 161.440 and 206.239 μg/mL, respectively. The toxicity of vinegar-processed products was significantly lower than the raw, and the development characteristic of zebrafish embryos at different times confirmed these results. The volatile oil of vinegar-processed products could inhibit the growth of intersegmental blood vessels at the dose of 20 μg/mL, while the raw materials did not exhibit such effect at the same concentration. The rat experiment also confirmed that the volatile oil could reduce toxicity of ovarian and uterine.<h4>Discussion and conclusions</h4>The study indicated that processing using vinegar could decrease toxicity and increase anti-angiogenic activity of <i>C. phaeocaulis</i>, which could be applied for clinical treatment. Further in-depth study on the synergism and detoxification mechanism of vinegar processing technology is needed."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Nowadays, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as a new lighting technology, have been emerged as an alternative source of light for plants due to their wavelength specificity, the narrow width of their bands, small size, solid structure, long lifetime, and low heat generation. Here we investigated the effect of different LED light sources on the essential oil components and antioxidant activity of Melissa officinalis. Two genotypes of lemon balm (Ilam and Isfahan) were subjected to four artificial light treatments, including white, red, blue, red + blue LEDs, and greenhouse light as natural lighting.<h4>Results</h4>The LED lights significantly increased shoot fresh and dry weights and leaf number in the two genotypes as compared to greenhouse condition. The results showed that the content and composition of essential oil in the two genotypes were variable under different light treatments and the total amount of compounds in the Ilam genotype was higher than the other genotype. The results of analysis of the essential oil by GC/MS indicated that the highest amount of monoterpenes in the genotypes was related to citronellal under red + blue LED lamps (15.3 and 17.2% in Ilam and Isfahan genotypes, respectively) but blue, white, and greenhouse condition had the most effect on sesquiterpenes content in both genotypes. The results showed that the observed variation between the two genotypes in the essentials oil composition was related to the relative percentage of the constituents and not to the appearance or lack of a specific component. Red + blue lighting also provided the highest radical scavenging activity in both genotypes (80.77 and 82.09% for Ilam and Isfahan genotypes, respectively). Based on principal component analyses (PCA), three main groups were identified regarding genotypes and all light treatments.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Overall, results indicated that the essentials oil composition of two genotypes of lemon balm was affected both qualitatively and quantitatively by different LED light sources; hence, LED lights might be used to improve monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and antioxidant activity in the selected genotypes."

      "The chemical profile, antiproliferative, antioxidant and antiphytoviral activities of the species <i>Hypericum perforatum</i> ssp. <i>veronense</i> (Schrank) H. Lindb. (Clusiaceae) were investigated. Free volatiles were isolated and the chemical composition was determined in the lipophilic fraction (essential oil) and for the first time in the water fraction (hydrosol). The aim is to provide phytochemical data for <i>H. perforatum</i> ssp. <i>veronense</i> useful for distinguishing ssp. <i>veronense</i> from ssp. <i>angustifolium</i>, as there are taxonomic disagreements between them and the composition of the secretory products may be helpful in this respect. In the essential oil, the most abundant compounds identified were α-pinene and <i>n</i>-nonane, while in the hydrosol, myrtenol, carvacrol and α-pinene were the most abundant. Overall, the class of monoterpenes and oxygenated monoterpenes dominated in the EO and hydrosol samples. The essential oil showed high antioxidant activity, in contrast to the antiproliferative activity, where the hydrosol showed exceptional activity against three cancer cell lines: Hela (cervical cancer cell line), HCT116 (human colon cancer cell line) and U2OS (human osteosarcoma cell line). Both the essential oil and hydrosol showed antiphytoviral activity against tobacco mosaic virus infection on the local host plants. This is the first report dealing with biological activities of hydrosol of <i>H. perforatum</i> ssp. <i>veronense</i>, and the obtained results suggest that this traditional medicinal plant is a valuable source of volatiles with promising antiproliferative, antioxidant and antiphytoviral activities."

      "Anti-quorum sensing (QS) or quorum quenching (QQ) is known as a new anti-bacterial strategy to combat bacterial infection. One of the best candidates for this strategy is a natural plant or traditional herbal medicine. This review aimed to summarize and introduce Iranian medicinal plants with anti-QS properties. Biomedical databases (PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Web of sciences) were investigated to retrieve all related manuscripts published in English and Persian. Out of 65 documents, 47 papers were published during 2010-2020. We categorized and summarized 19 papers that particularly presented the anti-QS activity of Iranian medicinal plants. Based on our results, different studies have been completed on the QQ effects of medicinal plants. We identified 106 plant species with different properties in medicine that have been evaluated for anti-QS activities in Iran. The QQ effects of herbal extracts were identified through different <i>in vitro</i> examinations on biosensor and clinical bacterial strains. Only 35 medicinal plants have shown these effects at sub-MICs. Our review summarizes Iranian medicinal plants with anti-QS properties. Some of these herbal extracts showed anti-QS activity against biosensors, standard and clinical bacterial strains. This result is very important because QS systems can be considered as a new target for the development of new remedial strategies and it is a good opportunity to perform QQ studies to effectively combat bacterial infections in the future."

      "<i>Carpesium cernuum</i> L., one of the two <i>Carpesium</i> species occurring in Europe, in the Far East and India, found use as a vegetable and a traditional medicinal remedy for several ailments. In the present study, compositions of essential oils distilled from roots and shoots of <i>C. cernuum</i> plants, cultivated in the open field, have been studied by GC-MS-FID supported by NMR spectroscopy. The analyses led to the identification of 120 compounds in total, of which 115 were found in aerial parts and 37 in roots of the plants. The major constituents found in the oil from shoots were: α-pinene (35%) and 2,5-dimethoxy-<i>p</i>-cymene (thymohydroquinone dimethyl ether, 12%), whereas 2,5-dimethoxy-<i>p</i>-cymene (55%), thymyl isobutyrate (9%) and thymol methyl ether (8%) predominated in the essential oil obtained from the roots. Antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of the essential oils distilled from <i>C. cernuum</i> were also tested. The essential oil from aerial parts of the plant demonstrated good inhibitory activity against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> ATCC 29213 and <i>Escherichia coli</i> ATCC 25922 (MIC: 15.6 μL/mL)."

      "Isolation and identification of natural products from plants is an essential approach for discovering drug candidates. Herein we report the characterization of three sesquiterpene lactones from a new genus <i>Shangwua</i>, e.g. onopordopicrin (ONP), C<b>2</b>, and C<b>3</b>, and evaluation of their pharmacological functions in interfering cellular redox signaling. Compared to C<b>2</b> and C<b>3</b>, ONP shows the most potency in killing cancer cells. Further experiments demonstrate that ONP robustly inhibits thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), which leads to perturbation of cellular redox homeostasis with the favor of oxidative stress. Knockdown of the TrxR sensitizes cells to the ONP treatment while overexpression of the enzyme reduces the potency of ONP, underpinning the correlation of TrxR inhibition to the cytotoxicity of ONP. The discovery of ONP expands the library of the natural TrxR inhibitors, and the disclosure of the action mechanism of ONP provides a foundation for the further development of ONP as an anticancer agent."

      "<i>Thymus vulgaris</i> Linn. is a medicinal and culinary herb from the Southern European region known for its anti-infective, cardioprotective, gastroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory activities since the Egyptian era. The reported pharmacological activities of <i>T. vulgaris</i> L. include antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and anti-cancerous activities. In this review, a comprehensive approach is put forth to scrutinize and report the available data on phytochemistry, ethnopharmacology, pharmacology, and toxicology of the plant. The different extracts and essential oil obtained from the plant have been assessed and reported to treat ailments like microbial infections, inflammation, non-communicable diseases like cancer, and sexually transmitted diseases like HIV-1 and Herpes. The literature review has also indicated the use of volatile oils, phenolic acids, terpenoids, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, alkaloids, and polysaccharides in pharmacotherapy. Applications of these compounds including antidiabetic, anti-Alzheimer's, cardio, neuro and hepatoprotective, anti-osteoporosis, sedative, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, anti-tyrosinase, antispasmodic, antinociceptive, gastroprotective, anticonvulsant, antihypertensive, antidepressant, anti-amnesia, and anti-helminthic activities have been mentioned. Further, based on research gaps, recommendations have been provided to evaluate <i>T. vulgaris</i> L. systematically to develop plant-based drugs, nutraceuticals, and to evaluate their clinical efficiency and safety."

      "<i>Ageratum conyzoides</i> L. (Family-Asteraceae) is an annual aromatic invasive herb, mainly distributed over the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It owns a reputed history of indigenous remedial uses, including as a wound dressing, an antimicrobial, and mouthwash as well as in treatment of dysentery, diarrhea, skin diseases, etc. In this review, the core idea is to present the antifungal potential of the selected medicinal plant and its secondary metabolites against different fungal pathogens. Additionally, toxicological studies (safety profile) conducted on the amazing plant <i>A. conyzoides</i> L. are discussed for the possible clinical development of this medicinal herb. Articles available from 2000 to 2020 were reviewed in detail to exhibit recent appraisals of the antifungal properties of <i>A. conyzoides</i>. Efforts were aimed at delivering evidences for the medicinal application of <i>A. conyzoides</i> by using globally recognized scientific search engines and databases so that an efficient approach for filling the lacunae in the research and development of antifungal drugs can be adopted. After analyzing the literature, it can be reported that the selected medicinal plant effectively suppressed the growth of numerous fungal species, such as <i>Aspergillus</i>, <i>Alternaria</i>, <i>Candida</i>, <i>Fusarium</i>, <i>Phytophthora</i>, and <i>Pythium</i>, owing to the presence of various secondary metabolites, particularly chromenes, terpenoids, flavonoids and coumarins. The possible mechanism of action of different secondary metabolites of the plant against fungal pathogens is also discussed briefly. However, it was found that only a few studies have been performed to demonstrate the plant's dosage and safety profile in humans. Considered all together, <i>A. conyzoides</i> extract and its constituents may act as a promising biosource for the development of effective antifungal formulations for clinical use. However, in order to establish safety and efficacy, additional scientific research is required to explore chronic toxicological effects of <i>ageratum</i>, to determine the probability of interactions when used with different herbs, and to identify safe dosage. The particulars presented here not only bridge this gap but also furnish future research strategies for the investigators in microbiology, ethno-pharmacology, and drug discovery."

      "<b>Background:</b> <i>Haemonchus contortus</i> is an important pathogenic nematode parasite and major economic constraint of small ruminants in tropics and subtropics regions. This review is an attempt to systematically address the; (a) efficacy of different plants against <i>H. contortus</i> by <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> proof; (b) toxicology, mechanism of action, and active phyto-compounds involve in anti-haemonchiasis activity; (c) and comparative analysis of plant species evaluated both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. <b>Methods:</b> Online databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect) were searched and published research articles (1980-2020) were gathered and reviewed. <b>Results:</b> A total of 187 plant species were reported belonging to 59 families and 145 genera with Asteraceae and Fabaceae being frequently used. Out of the total plant species, 171 species were found to be evaluated <i>in vitro</i> and only 40 species <i>in vivo</i>. Twenty-four species were commonly evaluated for <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> anti-haemonchiasis activity. Among the reported assays, egg hatching test (EHT) and fecal egg count reduction (FECR) were the most widely used assays <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, respectively. Moreover, sheep were the frequently used experimental model <i>in vivo</i>. After comparative analysis, <i>Lachesiodendron viridiflorum</i>, <i>Corymbia citriodora</i>, <i>Calotropis procera</i>, and <i>Artemisia herba-alba</i> were found highly effective both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. <i>L. viridiflorum</i> inhibited enzymatic activities and metabolic processes of the parasite and was found to be safe without toxic effects. <i>C. citriodora</i> was moderately toxic <i>in vivo</i>, however, the plant extract produced promising nematicidal effects by causing muscular disorganization and changes in the mitochondrial profile. Additionally, <i>C. procera</i> and <i>A. herba</i> <i>-alba</i> despite of their high anti-haemonchiasis activity were found to be highly toxic at the tested concentrations. <i>C. procera</i> caused perforation and tegumental disorganization along with adult worm paralysis. Nineteen compounds were reported, among which anethole and carvone completely inhibited egg hatching <i>in vitro</i> and significantly reduced fecal egg count, decreased male length, and reproductive capacity of female <i>in vivo</i>. <b>Conclusion:</b> This review summarized different medicinal plants owing to nematicidal activities against <i>H. contortus</i> eggs, larvae, and adult worms. Plants like <i>L. viridiflorum, C. citriodora, C. procera,</i> and <i>A. herba-alba</i>, while compounds anethole and carvone having promising nematicidal activities and could be an alternative source for developing novel drugs after further investigation."

      "Artemisia and its allied species have been employed for conventional medicine in the Northern temperate regions of North America, Europe, and Asia for the treatments of digestive problems, morning sickness, irregular menstrual cycle, typhoid, epilepsy, renal problems, bronchitis malaria, etc. The multidisciplinary use of artemisia species has various other health benefits that are related to its traditional and modern pharmaceutical perspectives. The main objective of this review is to evaluate the traditional, modern, biological as well as pharmacological use of the essential oil and herbal extracts of Artemisia nilagirica, Artemisia parviflora, and other allied species of Artemisia. It also discusses the botanical circulation and its phytochemical constituents viz disaccharides, polysaccharides, glycosides, saponins, terpenoids, flavonoids, and carotenoids. The plants have different biological importance like antiparasitic, antimalarial, antihyperlipidemic, antiasthmatic, antiepileptic, antitubercular, antihypertensive, antidiabetic, anxiolytic, antiemetic, antidepressant, anticancer, hepatoprotective, gastroprotective, insecticidal, antiviral activities, and also against COVID-19. Toxicological studies showed that the plants at a low dose and short duration are non or low-toxic. In contrast, a high dose at 3 g/kg and for a longer duration can cause toxicity like rapid respiration, neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, etc. However, further in-depth studies are needed to determine the medicinal uses, clinical efficacy and safety are crucial next steps."

      "The worldwide problem of infectious diseases has appeared in recent years, and antimicrobial agents are crucial in reducing disease emergence. Nevertheless, the development and distribution of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains in pathogenic bacteria, such as <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Salmonella Typhi</i> and <i>Citrobacter koseri</i>, has become a major society health hazard. Essential oils could serve as a promising tool as a natural drug in fighting the problem with these bacteria. The current study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial effectiveness of tea tree (<i>Melaleuca alternifolia</i> (Maiden and Betche) Cheel), rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i> L.), eucalyptus (<i>Eucalyptus obliqua</i> L'Hér.), and lavender (<i>Lavandula angustifolia</i> Mill) essential oils. The antimicrobial properties of essential oils were screened against four pathogenic bacteria, <i>E. coli</i>, <i>S. aureus</i>, <i>S. Tyhpi,</i> and <i>C. koseri</i>, and two reference bacterial strains, while for the testing, the agar well diffusion method was used. Gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (GC-MSD) analyses were performed on essential oils. The obtained results showed that <i>M. alternifolia</i> essential oil is the richest in terpinen-4-ol, <i>R. officinalis</i> and <i>E. oblique</i> essential oils in 1,8-cineole, and <i>L. angustifolia</i> essential oil in α-terpinyl acetate. In addition, the main bioactive compounds present in the essential oil of tea tree are rich in α-pinene (18.38%), limonene (7.55%) and γ-terpinene (14.01%). The essential oil of rosemary is rich in α-pinene (8.38%) and limonene (11.86%); eucalyptus essential oil has significant concentrations of α-pinene (12.60%), <i>p</i>-cymene (3.24%), limonene (3.87%), and γ-terpinene (7.37%), while the essential oil of lavender is rich in linalool (10.71%), linalool acetate (9.60%), α-terpinyl acetate (10.93%), and carbitol (13.05%) bioactive compounds, respectively. The obtained results from the in vitro study revealed that most of the essential oils exhibited antimicrobial properties. Among the tested essential oils, tea tree was discovered to demonstrate the strongest antimicrobial activity. The recorded MIC of <i>S. Typhi</i> was 6.2 mg/mL, 3.4 mg/mL of <i>C. koseri</i>, 3.1 mg/mL of <i>E. coli</i>, and 2.7 mg/mL of <i>E. coli</i> ATCC 25922, compared to <i>M. alternifolia</i>. Similarly, only <i>S. aureus</i> ATCC 25923 showed antimicrobial activity towards <i>R. officinalis</i> (1.4 mg/mL), <i>E. oblique</i> (2.9 mg/mL), and <i>L. angustifolia</i> (2.1 mg/mL). Based on the obtained results, it is possible to conclude that tea tree essential oil might be used as an ecological antimicrobial in treating infectious diseases caused by the tested pathogens."

      "<i>Artemisia jordanica</i> (AJ) is one of the folkloric medicinal plants and grows in the arid condition used by Palestinian Bedouins in the Al-Naqab desert for the treatment of diabetes and gastrointestinal infections. The current investigation aimed, for the first time, to characterize the (AJ) essential oil (EO) components and evaluate EO's antioxidant, anti-obesity, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and cytotoxic activities. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) technique was utilized to characterize the chemical ingredients of (AJ) EO, while validated biochemical approaches were utilized to evaluate the antioxidant, anti-obesity and antidiabetic. The microbicidal efficacy of (AJ) EO was measured utilizing the broth microdilution assay. Besides, the cytotoxic activity was estimated utilizing the (MTS) procedure. Finally, the anti-inflammatory activity was measured utilizing a COX inhibitory screening test kit. The analytical investigation revealed the presence of 19 molecules in the (AJ) EO. Oxygenated terpenoids, including bornyl acetate (63.40%) and endo-borneol (17.75%) presented as major components of the (AJ) EO. The EO exhibited potent antioxidant activity compared with Trolox, while it showed a weak anti-lipase effect compared with orlistat. In addition, the tested EO displayed a potent α-amylase suppressing effect compared with the positive control acarbose. Notably, the (AJ) EO exhibited strong α-glucosidase inhibitory potential compared with the positive control acarbose. The EO had has a cytotoxic effect against all the screened tumor cells. In fact, (AJ) EO showed potent antimicrobial properties. Besides, the EO inhibited the enzymes COX-1 and COX-2, compared with the anti-inflammatory drug ketoprofen. The (AJ) EO has strong antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-α-amylase, anti-α-glucosidase, and COX inhibitory effects which could be a favorite candidate for the treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases caused by harmful free radicals, microbial resistance, diabetes, and inflammations. Further in-depth investigations are urgently crucial to explore the importance of such medicinal plants in pharmaceutical production."

      "<i>Lannea egregia</i> (Anacardiaceae) and <i>Emilia sonchifolia</i> (Asteraceae) are plants used in traditional medicine in southwestern Nigeria. The essential oils from the leaves of <i>L. egregia</i> and <i>E. sonchifolia</i> were obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Both essential oils were dominated by sesquiterpenoids. The major components in <i>L. egregia</i> leaf essential oil were α-panasinsen (34.90%), (<i>E</i>)-caryophyllene (12.25%), α-copaene (11.39%), and selina-4,11-diene (9.29%), while <i>E. sonchifolia</i> essential oil was rich in γ-himachalene (25.16%), (<i>E</i>)-caryophyllene (15.72%), and γ-gurjunene (8.58%). The essential oils were screened for antimicrobial activity against a panel of bacteria and fungi and displayed minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 156 μg/mL to 625 μg/mL. Based on these results, either <i>L. egregia</i> or <i>E. sonchifolia</i> essential oil may be recommended for exploration as complementary antibacterial or antifungal agents."

      "Indigenous medicinal plants enriched with flavonoids, alkaloids, poly-phenolic compounds carry antiseptic, disinfectant and antimicrobial activities. During old era, plant extracts were used as strong antiseptics and disinfectants to get ride from microbes. We aimed to present the herbal formulations and preparations for human health hazards free hand sanitizers based on indigenous medicinal plants with reported effective results against infectious microbes along with least toxic impact on environment. Easily available plants formulations safe to human health and environment are presented with easy procedure for their preparations. Data have been collected from literature for dissemination to scientific community and common society. A recent report published on human health hazards linked with the frequent use of alcohol based hand sanitizers provoked the scientific community to prepare safe hand rubs. National Poison Data System, USA revealed 36.7% increase in alcoholic hand sanitizer exposure and toxicity in first three months of 2020 as compared to 2019. Adaptation of alternative preparations of hand sanitizers based on natural and plant resources are the possible solution to get ride off toxicity problem. There should be more detailed screenings of indigenous plants with enriched flavonoids contents for their antiseptic properties and to develop eco-friendly and effective hand sanitizers as compared to chemical formulations."

      "<i>Zingiber ottensii</i> Valeton (ZO) exhibits pharmacological activity and has long been used in traditional medicine. However, reports about its safety profiles are limited. The present study aimed to evaluate the phytochemical profile and the toxic effects of ZO essential oil on the development of zebrafish and acute oral toxicity in rats. The essential oil was isolated from ZO rhizomes, and phytochemicals were analyzed using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The embryotoxic and teratogenic effects of ZO essential oil were evaluated in zebrafish embryos and larvae and the acute oral toxicity was determined in rats. GC-MS results showed the essential oil contained zerumbone as a major phytoconstituent (24.73%). The zebrafish embryotoxicity of ZO essential oil appeared to be concentration- and time-dependent manner, with a moderate LC<sub>50</sub> (1.003 µg/mL). Teratogenicity in zebrafish embryos also included morphological defects, decreased hatchability, and reduced heart rate. In rats, ZO essential oil (2000 mg/kg, p.o.) resulted in no mortality or significant toxicities. These findings suggest that ZO has embryotoxic and teratogenic effects in zebrafish embryos but does not result in death or acute oral toxicity in rats. Further long-term toxicity studies are needed to confirm the safety of products developed from ZO essential oil."

      "The interest in za'atar has increased in recent years due to its economic, cultural, and functional importance. The traditional za'atar mix made from dried <i>Origanum syriacum</i> is now a demanded product nationally and internationally. Air-drying at low temperatures can preserve za'atar quality traits better than other techniques such as oven-drying. The Palestinian za'atar market has the potential to develop and increase its value. However, it is facing many challenges. Another valuable product of za'atar is essential oil. Za'atar essential oil quantity and quality are affected by many factors including geographical location, cultivation, harvesting season, soil, extraction method, temperature, and others. These factors interact with za'atar and with each other; therefore, some factors are more effective than others and further research is needed to determine the optimum condition for producing and obtaining za'atar essential oil. Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities are the main functionalities of za'atar essential oil that are behind its medicinal importance. One hundred and twenty-one compounds have been identified in za'atar essential oil. The most common compounds are thymol, γ-terpinene, carvacrol, and α-pinene. The variation in the composition among za'atar essential oil samples results from the different conditions of the studies during za'atar growth as well as essential oil extraction."

      "Natural compounds obtained from different medicinal and aromatic plants have gained respect as alternative treatments to synthetic drugs, as well as raw materials for different applications (cosmetic, food and feed industries, environment protection, and many others). Based on a literature survey on dedicated databases, the aim of the present work is to be a critical discussion of aspects regarding classical extraction versus modern extraction techniques; possibilities to scale up (advantages and disadvantages of different extraction methods usually applied and the influence of extraction parameters); and different medicinal and aromatic plants' different applications (medical and industrial applications, as well as the potential use in nanotechnology). As nowadays, research studies are directed toward the development of modern, innovative applications of the medicinal and aromatic plants, aspects regarding future perspectives are also discussed."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Emerging of multidrug-resistant bacteria can compromise the effectiveness of antibiotics used to treat skin infections. Those bacteria imposed public health problems and questioning medical care in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. In this circumstance, essential oils of medicinal plants origin are supreme sources of structural and functionally divergent compounds, which inhibited the growth of common wound colonizing MRSA and ESBL producing <i>P. aeruginosa.</i> The aim of this study was to evaluate the combined antibacterial activity of essential oils extracted from <i>Rumex abyssinicus, Cucumis pustulatus,</i> and <i>Discopodium penninervium</i> against multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates of skin ulcers.<h4>Methods</h4>Essential oils (EOs) were extracted from aerial parts of <i>R. abyssinicus, C. pustulatus</i>, and <i>D. penninervium</i> with steam distillation. A mixture of each oil (1 : 1) was adsorbed to a disc and placed on Mueller Hinton Agar. Then, minimum zone of inhibition and bactericidal concentration of EOs was measured after incubeted for 18-24 hours at 37 °C. Their combined antibacterial effect was determined by the fractional inhibitory concentration index.<h4>Results</h4>The antibacterial activity of mixed oil varied in their doses and bacteria species, of which a mixture of essential oil of <i>R. abyssinicus</i> and <i>D. penninervium</i> had inhibition zone (32 mm); its MIC and MBC values range from 1-2 <i>μ</i>l/ml against MRSA. It had an inhibition zone (36 mm), MIC value 4 <i>μ</i>l/ml, and MBC (8 <i>μ</i>l/ml) against ESBL producing <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, whereas combined effects of <i>R. abyssinicus</i> and <i>C. pustulatus</i> had MIC values ranging from 2-8 <i>μ</i>l/ml for <i>E. coli</i> and <i>K. pneumoniae</i> and 2 <i>μ</i>l/ml for MRSA. There was a strong synergistic effect between <i>R. abyssinicus</i> and <i>D. penninervium</i> and promising antibacterial effect more specifically on MRSA and <i>P. aeruginosa. Conclusion</i>. This in vitro study of the combined effect of EOs has significant antibacterial activity on wound colonizing bacteria and reduces delaying wound healing as that of modern drugs tested in parallel. Hence, further structural elucidation of active compounds helps us to properly design or synthesis of topical antibiotics for wound care."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Safrole is a natural compound extracted from various plants, and has shown various biological activities. The current study aimed to investigate the antioxidant, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, and anticancer activity of safrole oil and to study the influence of safrole nanoemulgel on these activities.<h4>Methods</h4>The antioxidant and antidiabetic in-vitro assays were conducted using standard biomedical methods. The safrole oil nanoemulgel was developed using a self-emulsifying technique. Then the antimicrobial activity of the safrole oil and safrole nanoemulgel were performed on different microbial species, and cytotoxicity was determined against Hep3B cancer cell lines using the MTS assay.<h4>Results</h4>Safrole oil showed moderate antioxidant activity compared with standard Trolox, with IC<sub>50</sub> value 50.28 ± 0.44 and 1.55 ± 0.32 μg/ml, respectively. Moreover, it had potent α-amylase inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub> 11.36 ± 0.67 μg/ml) compared with Acarbose (IC<sub>50</sub> value 5.88 ± 0.63). The safrole nanoemulgel had pseudo-plastic behaviour, droplet sizes below 200 nm, a polydispersity index (PDI) below 0.3, and a zeta potential of less than - 30 mV. Safrole oil has potential antimicrobial and anticancer activities, and these activities were improved with safrole nanoemulgel.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The safrole oil may be applied for the prevention and treatment of oxidative stress, diabetes, different microbial species and cancer, and these activities could be improved by nano-carriers."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Elaeagnus umbellata Thunb. (autumn olive) is a high valued medicinal plant. It belongs to Elaeagnaceae family and is widely distributed in Himalayan regions of Pakistan. In the present study essential oil were extracted from the fruit of this plant and their antioxidant, anticholinesterase and antidiabetic potentials were also evaluated.<h4>Methods</h4>Essential oils were extracted from the fruit of E. umbellata using hydro-distillation method and were characterized by GC-MS. The extracted oil were tested for its antioxidant, anticholinesterase, and antidiabetic potentials using standard protocols.<h4>Results</h4>About 68 compounds were identified by GC-MS. The extracted oil exhibited a fairly high free radical scavenging activities against DPPH and ABTS radicals with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 70 and 105 μg/mL respectively (for ascorbic acid, used as standard, the IC<sub>50</sub> values were 32 and 29 μg/mL, respectively against the mentioned radicals). The essential oil also exhibited anticholinesterase activities with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 48 and 90 μg/mL respectively against AChE and BChE (for galantamine used as standard, the IC<sub>50</sub> values were 25 and 30 μg/mL respectively). The essential oil also exhibited antidiabetic potential with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 120 and 110 μg/mL respectively against α-glucosidase and α-amylase (IC<sub>50</sub> values for standard acarbose = 28 and 30 μg/mL respectively).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Essential oil extracted from the fruits of E. umbellata exhibited reasonable antioxidant, anticholinesterase, and antidiabetic potentials that could be used as alternative medicine in treating diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders. However, further studies are needed to isolate responsible compounds and evaluate the observed potential in animal models."

      "Essential oils are natural products that have great antimicrobial potential value against many fungi and bacteria. Rosa damascena Mill. is one of the most important aromatic species of the Rosaceae family from which essential oil and economically valuable products can be obtained. The present study was designed to investigate the major compositions of the essential oil of this plant in Isfahan region of Iran and to identify its antibacterial and antifungal effects against 11 microorganisms causing human diseases and food spoilage. The essential oil was extracted by using the Clevenger apparatus and was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique. Its antimicrobial activity was evaluated by well diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericide concentration (MBC). The results showed that the most important compounds of the essential oil were nonadecane (24.72%), heneicosane (19.325%), oleic acid (17.63%), and citronellol (12.61%). The results also showed that the highest inhibition zone of rose essential oil was against Aspergillus brasiliensis (15.00 ± 0.00 mm) and had a significant effect on Klebsiella pneumoniae (~ 8.00 mm). Also the rose oil had a significant inhibition and lethal effect against Candida albicans (MIC and MBC ~ 125 μg/mL), which is equivalent to the nystatin antibiotic (~ 125 μg/mL). Therefore, the essential oil of Damask rose can be considered as an alternative natural product for the prevention and treatment of fungal diseases in humans and against food spoilage as well."

      "The aim of the present research was to determine the chemical composition and the cytotoxic effects of <i>Tetraclinis articulata</i> trunk bark essential oil (HEE) obtained by steam distillation and five fractions obtained by normal phase silica chromatographic separation. Chemical analysis allowed the identification of 54 known compounds. Relatively high amounts of oxygenated sesquiterpenes (44.4-70.2%) were detected, mainly consisting of caryophyllene oxide (13.1-26.6%), carotol (9.2-21.2%),14-hydroxy-9-<i>epi</i>-(<i>E</i>)-caryophyllene (3.2-15.5%) and humulene epoxide II (2.6-7.2%). The cytotoxic activity against human mammary carcinoma cell lines (MDA-MB-231) and colorectal carcinoma cell lines (SW620) of the essential oil and its fractions were assessed. All the samples displayed moderate to weak activity compared to 5-fluorouracil. The colorectal carcinoma cell line was relatively more sensitive to the essential oil and its fractions compared to the breast cancer cell line, showing IC<sub>50</sub> values from 25.7 to 96.5 μg/mL. In addition, the essential oil and its fraction E.2 revealed a cytotoxic activity against colorectal carcinoma cell line, with IC<sub>50</sub> values lower than 30 μg/mL. This is the first report on the chemical composition and cytotoxic activity of the trunk bark essential oil of <i>T. articulata</i>."

      "The current COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is enormously affecting the worldwide health and economy. In the wait for an effective global immunization, the development of a specific therapeutic protocol to treat COVID-19 patients is clearly necessary as a short-term solution of the problem. Drug repurposing and herbal medicine represent two of the most explored strategies for an anti-COVID-19 drug discovery. Clove (<i>Syzygium aromaticum</i> L.) is a well-known culinary spice that has been used for centuries in folk medicine in many disorders. Interestingly, traditional medicines have used clove since ancient times to treat respiratory ailments, whilst clove ingredients show antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Other interesting features are the clove antithrombotic, immunostimulatory, and antibacterial effects. Thus, in this review, we discuss the potential role of clove in the frame of anti-COVID-19 therapy, focusing on the antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antithrombotic effects of clove and its molecular constituents described in the scientific literature."

      "Despite progress achieved, there is limited available information about the antibacterial activity of constituents of essential oils (EOs) from different medicinal-aromatic plants (MAPs) against fish pathogens and the complex interactions of blended EOs thereof. The present study aimed to investigate possible synergistic antimicrobial effects of EOs from seven Greek MAPs with strong potential against <i>Aeromonas veronii</i> bv. <i>sobria,</i> a fish pathogen associated with aquaculture disease outbreaks. The main objective was to evaluate whether blending of these EOs can lead to increased antimicrobial activity against the specific microorganism. A total of 127 combinations of EOs were prepared and their effect on <i>A. veronii</i> bv. <i>sobria</i> growth was tested in vitro. We examined both the inhibitory and bactericidal activities of the individual EOs and compared them to those of the blended EOs. The vast majority of the investigated combinations exhibited significant synergistic and additive effects, while antagonistic effects were evident only in a few cases, such as the mixtures containing EOs from rosemary, lemon balm and pennyroyal. The combination of EOs from Greek oregano and wild carrot, as well as the combinations of those two with Spanish oregano or savoury were the most promising ones. Overall, Greek oregano, savoury and Spanish oregano EOs were the most effective ones when applied either in pure form or blended with other EOs."

      "Nigella sativa L. is a medicinal plant with extensive, nutritional, pharmaceutical, and health applications. Nowadays, reducing the application of chemical fertilizers (synthetic fertilizers) is one of the main goals of sustainable agriculture to allow the production of safe crops. Therefore, the combined effect of urea and biofertilizers was studied on the quantitative and qualitative traits of N. sativa L. in a randomized complete block design with 10 treatments and three replications. The treatments included control (no fertilization), U (100% chemical fertilizer as urea at 53.3 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>, Nb (Biofertilizer, Azotobacter vinelandii), Pb (Biofertilizer, Pantoea agglomerans and Pseudomonas putida), Kb (Biofertilizer, Bacillus spp.), NPKb (NPK, biofertilizer), Nb + 50% U, Pb + 50% U, Kb + 50%U and NPKb + 50% U. The NPK(b) + U50% was related to the highest quantity of plant height, branch diameter, capsule (follicle) number per plant, auxiliary branches, seed yield per plant, thousand-seed weight, essential oil content, total phenolic compounds, flavonoid content, DPPH free radical scavenging, nitric oxide (NO) radical scavenging, superoxide radical scavenging, chain-breaking activity, phosphorus content, and potassium content, along with U for the highest biological yield and (Pb) + U50% for the highest essential oil percentage which is close to (NPKb) + U50%. The lowest value was observed in all traits related to the control treatment except for branch diameter that was related to (NPKb). Hence, the application of (NPKb) + U50% as bio-chemical fertilizers improved N. sativa L. Traits, so it can be recommended."

      "<i>Artemisia abrotanum</i> L. (southern wormwood) is a plant species with an important position in the history of European and Asian medicine. It is a species famous as a medicinal plant in Central Asia, Asia Minor, and in South-East and Central Europe. The raw materials obtained from this species are <i>Abrotani herba</i> and <i>Abrotani folium</i>. In the traditional European medicine, they have been used successfully most of all in liver and biliary tract diseases, in parasitic diseases in children and as antipyretic medication. In the official European medicine, this plant species is recommended by the French Pharmacopoeia for use in homeopathy. In many European countries, it is used traditionally in allopathy. The latest studies on the biological activity of extracts from the aboveground parts of the plant and/or the leaves, and/or the essential oil have provided evidence of other possible applications related to their antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, anticancer, and antiallergic properties. The latest studies have also focused on the repellent activity of the essential oil of this species and the possibility to use it in the prevention of diseases in which insects are the vectors. The main substances obtained from the plant that are responsible for this activity are: the essential oil, coumarins, phenolic acids, and flavonoids. Some of the latest investigations emphasize the large differences in the composition of the essential oil, determined by the geographical (climatic) origin of the plant. <i>A. abrotanum</i> is recommended by the European Cosmetic Ingredients Database (CosIng) as a source of valuable cosmetic ingredients. Additionally, the leaves of this species possess a well-established position in the food industry. This plant species is also the object of biotechnological studies."

      "This work is a summary of the characterization, activities, and ethnobotanical surveys about aromatic and medicinal plants belonging to the genus Mentha in Morocco. The Mentha species investigated are <i>Mentha pulegium, Mentha spicata</i>, <i>Mentha viridis</i>, <i>Mentha suaveolens</i>, <i>Mentha longifolia</i>, <i>Mentha gattefossei</i>, <i>Mentha rotundifolia</i>, and <i>Mentha vulgare</i>, with <i>M. pulegium</i> being the most studied species. <i>M. spicata</i> and <i>M. viridis</i> are poorly explored even though they are daily consumed by Moroccans in tea infusions. The elucidated factors affecting the composition of Mentha essential oils are fertilization, drying conditions, mechanical impedance, NaCl stress, and Gamma irradiation. Investigation of the activities of the Mentha species showed that the main interest was dedicated to addressing the antibacterial effect towards gram+ and gram- bacteria. Essential oils of Mentha species exhibited antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, insecticidal, licidal, niticidal, allelopathic, antidiabetic, derma-protective, and anticorrosive activities. The ethnobotanical surveys revealed that Mentha species are used in seven regions: Tafilalet, High Atlas, Fez-Boulemane, Taounat, Oujda, Ouazzane, and Rabat. By calculating the Jaccard index, the highest degree of similarity was found between Tafilalet, Rabat, and Oujda regions. The wide use of the Mentha species in Morocco highlights the high ethnobotanical value of the genus."

      "This study describes the chemical composition, antitumor, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities of the plant <i>Thymus algeriensis</i> Boiss. Essential oils (EOs) were collected in different periods (before, during, and after flowering stage) from the El-Guetfa region, M'sila, Algeria. The EOs extraction was achieved using three distinguishing techniques: hydro (Clevenger trap), steam, and microwave distillations, targeting different aerial parts of the plant (stems, flowers, and leaves). The EOs chemical components were estimated using GC-FID and GC-MS apparatuses. The resulting yield of the extracted oil was moderate and ranged between 0.84 and 1.53% (<i>wt</i>/<i>vol</i>). In total, eighty-five components were identified, in which the oxygenated monoterpenes family formed the main portion, starting from 40.56 up to 70.66%. The obtained essential oil was dominated by five major components that varied from low to quite moderate percentages: camphor (17.45-32.56%), borneol (11.16-22.2%), camphene (7.53-12.86%), 1.8-cineole (5.16-11.21%), and bornyl acetate (3.86-7.92%). The biological results of this oil pointed out that the EOs extracted from the leaves part exposed a weak radical scavenging activity afterward using two well-known antioxidant assays DPPH (IC<sub>50</sub> = 8.37 mg/mL) and ABTS (10.84 mg/mL). Meanwhile, this oil presented strong inhibition activity against colon cancer cell line HCT116 (LC50 = 39.8 µg/mL) and a moderate inhibitory against hepatocellular cancer cells HePG2 (LC50 > 100 µg/mL). In addition, this oil antimicrobial activity was quite important against <i>Micrococcus luteus (M. luteus</i>)<i>, Staphylococcus aureus</i> CIP 7625, <i>Escherichia coli</i> ATCC 10536, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> ATCC <i>4226</i>, <i>Candida albicans</i> IPA200, <i>Candida tropicalis (Ct),</i> and <i>Candida glabrata (Cg)</i> after using Amoxicillin and Itraconazole as references."

      "<h4>Background and objectives</h4><i>Escherichia coli</i> and some <i>Salmonella</i> serovars cause various disease manifestations in poultry leading to significant economic losses. The widespread and imprudent use of antibacterial agents in poultry flocks have increased resistant to many antibacterial agents which has become a major public health concern. Some medicinal plants may be alternative to antibacterial agents. The purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity of summer savory essential oil against <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Salmonella</i> isolated from poultry.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The essential oil was extracted using a Clevenger apparatus and subsequently its compounds were determined using GC-MS. Antibacterial properties of essential oil were determined by disc diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). To evaluate the anti-biofilm properties the Microtiter plate test was used. Herbal essential oil was extracted and its compounds were identified correctly.<h4>Results</h4>The major components of <i>Satureja hortensis</i> essential oil were thymol (41.28%), γ-terpinene (37.63%), p-cymene (12.2%) and α-terpinene (3.52%). The inhibition zone diameter in the disc diffusion test for <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Salmonella</i> were 32 ± 3 and 38 ± 4 mm, respectively, which was confirmed by MIC and MBC values. Regarding anti-biofilm activity, the MIC/2 concentration of <i>S. hortensis</i> significantly inhibited biofilm formation of <i>E. coli</i>. However, inhibition of biofilm formation of <i>Salmonella</i> was shown at concentration of MIC/2 and MIC/4.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Based on our results, <i>S. hortensis</i> essential oil showed the growth inhibition and bactericidal activity against <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Salmonella</i>. Moreover, this study demonstrated anti-biofilm activity of <i>S. hortensis</i> essential against both tested bacteria."

      "<h4>Background and aim</h4><i>Bacillus</i> species are widely distributed microorganisms in nature that are responsible for outbreaks of food poisoning and a common cause of food spoilage. This study aimed to isolate and identify foodborne <i>Bacillus</i> species from meat and to determine the antimicrobial activities of commercial essential oils and spices powder extracted from certain medicinal plants.<h4>Methods</h4>Sixty meat samples were collected in Assiut city and subdivided into raw meat and processed meat. <i>Bacillus</i> spp were isolated and identified according to their cultural characters, biochemical reactions, serological typing, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The antibacterial activity of essential oils and spices powder was measured by using well-diffusion and microbial count techniques.<h4>Results</h4>The prevalence of <i>Bacillus</i> spp. in the examined raw meat samples and processed meat samples was 13.34%, and 26.67%, respectively. There was a marked decrease in the total <i>Bacillus</i> species count after treatment of minced beef with essential oils and spices powder compared to the untreated one. Black seed oil was the most potent antibacterial essential oil among the tested oils present in this study.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Essential oils and spices powder of certain medicinal plants (cumin: <i>Cuminum cyminum</i>, black seeds: <i>Nigella sativa</i>, cloves: <i>Syzygium aromaicum</i>, cinnamon: <i>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</i>, and Marjoram: <i>Origanum majorana</i>) have a potential in vitro antimicrobial activity against <i>Bacillus</i> spp. Furthermore, <i>Nigella sativa</i> oil exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity against <i>Bacillus</i> spp."

      "Essential oils prevent superbug formation, which is mainly caused by the continuous use of synthetic drugs. This is a significant threat to health, the environment, and food safety. Plant extracts in the form of essential oils are good enough to destroy pests and fight bacterial infections in animals and humans. In this review article, different essential oils containing polymeric nanofibers fabricated by electrospinning are reviewed. These nanofibers containing essential oils have shown applications in biomedical applications and as food-packaging materials. This approach of delivering essential oils in nanoformulations has attracted considerable attention in the scientific community due to its low price, a considerable ratio of surface area to volume, versatility, and high yield. It is observed that the resulting nanofibers possess antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Therefore, they can reduce the use of toxic synthetic drugs that are utilized in the cosmetics, medicine, and food industries. These nanofibers increase barrier properties against light, oxygen, and heat, thereby protecting and preserving the food from oxidative damage. Moreover, the nanofibers discussed are introduced with naturally derived chemical compounds in a controlled manner, which simultaneously prevents their degradation. The nanofibers loaded with different essential oils demonstrate an ability to increase the shelf-life of various food products while using them as active packaging materials."

      "Plant products provide an alternative and successful source of lead compounds for the pharmaceutical industry. The present study was aimed to evaluate, in cell-based assays, the antiviral properties of essential oils obtained from plants that commonly grow in Sardinia, Italy, against a broad spectrum of RNA/DNA viruses. The essential oils of <i>Helichrisumitalicum</i> (Roth) G. Don ssp. <i>microphyllum</i> (Willd.) Nyman, <i>Laurus nobilis</i> L., <i>Mirtuscommunis</i> L., <i>Pistacia lentiscus</i> L., <i>Salvia officinalis</i> L., <i>Saturejathymbra</i> L., <i>Lavandula angustifolia</i> Mill., <i>Foeniculum vulgare</i> Mill., and <i>Eucalyptus globulus</i> Labill. were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Interestingly, the essential oil of <i>Salvia officinalis</i> showed moderate activity against bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), an enveloped RNA virus belonging to the <i>Flaviviridae</i> family. BVDV is responsible for several clinical manifestations in bovines, including respiratory, gastroenteric, and reproductive diseases, with a significant economic impact. With the aim to individuate the constituent of the <i>Salvia officinalis</i> responsible for the biological activity, we tested the major components of the oil: camphene, β-pinene, limonene, 1,8-cineole, cis-thujone, camphor, (E)-caryophyllene, and α-humulene. Here, we describe α-humulene as an active component that is non-cytotoxic and active against BVDV (EC<sub>50</sub> = 36 µM). Its antiviral effects were evaluated using virucidal cytopathic effect inhibition and viral yield reduction assays. This is the first scientific report showing the anti BVDV effects of <i>Salvia officinalis</i> essential oil and α-humulene as the main active component."

      "The functional food market is growing with a compound annual growth rate of 7.9%. Thai food recipes use several kinds of herbs. Lemongrass, garlic, and turmeric are ingredients used in Thai curry paste. Essential oils released in the preparation step create the flavor and fragrance of the famous tom yum and massaman dishes. While the biological activities of these ingredients have been investigated, including the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the responses to the essential oils of these plants. To investigate the effects of essential oil inhalation on the brain and mood responses, electroencephalography was carried out during the non-task resting state, and self-assessment of the mood state was performed. The essential oils were prepared in several dilutions in the range of the supra-threshold level. The results show that <i>Litsea cubeba</i> oil inhalation showed a sedative effect, observed from alpha and beta wave power reductions. The frontal and temporal regions of the brain were involved in the wave alterations. Garlic oil increased the alpha wave power at lower concentrations; however, a sedative effect was also observed at higher concentrations. Lower dilution oil induced changes in the fast alpha activity in the frontal region. The alpha and beta wave powers were decreased with higher dilution oils, particularly in the temporal, parietal, and occipital regions. Both <i>Litsea cubeba</i> and turmeric oils resulted in better positive moods than garlic oil. Garlic oil caused more negative moods than the others. The psychophysiological activities and the related brain functions require further investigation. The knowledge obtained from this study may be used to design functional food products."

      "Medicinal plants and their derived compounds have drawn the attention of researchers due to their considerable impact on human health. Among medicinal plants, mint (<i>Mentha</i> species) exhibits multiple health beneficial properties, such as prevention from cancer development and anti-obesity, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and cardioprotective effects, as a result of its antioxidant potential, combined with low toxicity and high efficacy. <i>Mentha</i> species are widely used in savory dishes, food, beverages, and confectionary products. Phytochemicals derived from mint also showed anticancer activity against different types of human cancers such as cervix, lung, breast and many others. Mint essential oils show a great cytotoxicity potential, by modulating MAPK and PI3k/Akt pathways; they also induce apoptosis, suppress invasion and migration potential of cancer cells lines along with cell cycle arrest, upregulation of Bax and p53 genes, modulation of TNF, IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-8, and induction of senescence phenotype. Essential oils from mint have also been found to exert antibacterial activities against <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, <i>Streptococcus aureus</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and many others. The current review highlights the antimicrobial role of mint-derived compounds and essential oils with a special emphasis on anticancer activities, clinical data and adverse effects displayed by such versatile plants."

      "<i>Momordica charantia</i> (MC) is popular for its medicinal uses especially for treating diabetic-related complications. However, the antiulcer activity of essential oil derived from the seeds has not been systematically studied. This study aims to evaluate the gastroprotective activities of essential oil derived from the seed of MC induced by hydrochloride acid/ethanol (HCl/EtOH) and indomethacin and pylorus-ligation model. Gastric ulceration was induced by oral administration of HCl/EtOH solution or indomethacin on day 7 after animals have been pretreated with testing compounds. The first group received just distilled water and the second group received ranitidine (100 mg/kg). Groups 3, 4, and 5 received 10, 50, and 100 mg/kg of essential oil based on their body weight (10 mL/kg), respectively. Macroscopically, pretreatment of essential oil extracted from MC significantly decreased ulceration induced by HCl/EtOH and indomethacin <i>in vivo</i>. Microscopically, essential oil also significantly suppressed the formation of edema, epithelial disruption, and mucosa erosions. Moreover, essential oil significantly elevated the pH without decreasing the total acidity of the gastric juice and was able to increase the amount of adherent mucus compared to control. Current results provide scientific basis to the ethno-pharmacological usage of the MC in preventing ulcer formation induced by HCl/EtOH and indomethacin."

      "<i>Artemisia dracunculus</i> L. (tarragon), Asteraceae, is a species that has long been used in traditional Asian medicine, mainly in Iran, Pakistan, Azerbaijan and India. It is known as a spice species in Asia, Europe and the Americas. The raw materials obtained from this species are herb and leaf. The presence of essential oil with a highly variable composition, as well as flavonoids, phenolic acids, coumarins and alkamides, determines the medicinal and/or spice properties of the plant. In traditional Asian medicine, this species is used, for example, in the treatment of digestive system diseases, as an analgesic, hypnotic, antiepileptic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic agent, and as an effective remedy in the treatment of helminthiasis. Nowadays, <i>A. dracunculus</i> is the subject of professional phytochemical and pharmacological researches. Pharmacological studies have confirmed its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects known from traditional uses; they have also proved very important new findings regarding its biological activity, such as antioxidant, immunomodulating and anti-tumour activities, as well as hepatoprotective and hypoglycaemic effects. <i>A. dracunculus</i> has long-held an established position in the food industry as a spice. And its use is growing in the cosmetics industry. Moreover, it is the subject of biotechnological research focused mainly on the development of micro-propagation protocols."

      "<i>Lavandula angustifolia</i>, one of the most popular medicinal plants, is the source of a bioactive essential oil characterized by a wide spectrum of biological activity, e.g., antiseptic, analgesic, and anticancer effects. In dermatology, the oil helps to relieve skin inflammation and exhibit wound healing potential. However, the mechanism of action of the lavender oil depends on its composition, which in turn is dependent on the origin and growing conditions. Our study aimed to compare the composition and proregenerative properties of the commercially-available narrow-leaved lavender oil produced in Provence, France, with the oil obtained from the narrow-leaved lavender cultivated locally in Poland. GC/MS analysis showed that self-manufactured essential oil had lower linalool content than commercial oil (23.2 vs. 40.2%), comparable linalyl acetate content (40.6 vs. 44%), while the proportion of lavandulyl acetate was significantly higher (23.2 vs. 5.5%). To determine the influence of lavender oil on the production of proinflammatory cytokines and proregenerative growth factors, gene expression of the selected signaling molecules by HaCaT cells was investigated using real-time PCR. Results showed a concentration-dependent effect of lavender oils on the production of IL-6, IL-8, and VEGF by the keratinocyte cell line. Finally, the potential of the lavender oil to increase the production of VEGF, the most important angiogenic factor, with the in-house preparation performing significantly better in the in vitro cell models was identified."

      "<h4>Purpose</h4>Alternative methods for the use of animals in research have gained increasing importance, due to assessments evaluating the real need for their use and the development of legislation that regulates the subject. The principle of the 3R's (replacement, reduction and refinement) has been an important reference, such that in vitro, ex vivo and cord replacement methods have achieved a prominent place in research.<h4>Methods</h4>Therefore, due to successful results from studies developed with these methods, the present study aimed to evaluate the myorelaxant effect of the <i>Dysphania ambrosioides</i> essential oil (EODa) using a <i>Sus scrofa domesticus</i> coronary artery model, and the toxicity of both the <i>Dysphania ambrosioides</i> essential oil and its major constituent, α-terpinene, against <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> in toxicity and negative geotaxis assays.<h4>Results</h4>The EODa relaxed the smooth muscle of swine coronary arteries precontracted with K<sup>+</sup> and 5-HT in assays using <i>Sus scrofa domesticus</i> coronary arteries. The toxicity results presented LC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.546 mg/mL and 2.282 mg/mL for the EODa and α-terpinene, respectively, thus showing the EODa and α-terpinene presented toxicity to these dipterans, with the EODa being more toxic.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Moreover, the results reveal the possibility of using the EODa in vascular disease studies since it promoted the relaxation of the Sus scrofa domesticus coronary smooth muscle."

      "The parasitic diseases represent the most important health risk, especially in underdeveloped countries where they have a deep impact on public health. Trichomoniasis is a prevalent non-viral sexually transmitted disease, and a significant amount of new cases are identified each year globally. Furthermore, the infection is linked with serious concerns such as pregnancy outcomes, infertility, predisposition to cervical and prostate cancer, and increased transmission and acquisition of HIV. The therapy is restricted, adverse effects are often observed, and resistance to the drugs is emerging. Based on this, a new treatment for trichomoniasis is necessary. Natural products represent a rich source of bioactive compounds, and even today, they are used in the search for new drugs. Additionally, natural products provide a wide variety of leadership structures that can be used by the pharmaceutical industry as a template in the development of new drugs that are more effective and have fewer or no undesirable side effects compared to current treatments. This review focuses on the medicinal plants that possess anti-trichomonal activity in vitro or in vivo. An electronic database search was carried out covering the last three decades, i.e., 1990-2020. The literature search revealed that almost a dozen isolated phytoconstituents are being explored globally for their anti-trichomonal activity. Simultaneously, many countries have their own traditional or folk medicine for trichomoniasis that utilizes their native plants, as a whole, or even extracts. This review focuses mainly on the human parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. However, at some points mention is also made to Tritrichomonas foetus that causes trichomoniasis in animals of high veterinary and economical interest. We will focus on the plants and plant-based compounds and their anti-trichomonal activity. The literature search highlighted that there are abundant compounds that possess anti-trichomonal activity; however, in-depth in-vivo evaluation of compounds and their clinical evaluation has not been undertaken. There is a critical need for new anti-trichomonal compounds, and focused research on phytoconstituents can provide the way forward."

      "Essential oils (EOs) and extracts of rose geranium (<i>Pelargonium graveolens</i>) and petals of rose (<i>Rosa damascena</i>) have been fully characterized in terms of composition, safety, antimicrobial, and antiviral properties. They were analyzed against <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Aspergillus niger</i>, and Adenovirus 35. Their toxicity and life span were also determined. EO of <i>P. graveolens</i> (5%) did not retain any antibacterial activity (whereas at 100% it was greatly effective against <i>E. coli</i>), had antifungal activity against <i>A. niger</i>, and significant antiviral activity. Rose geranium extract (dilutions 25-90%) (<i>v</i>/<i>v</i>) had antifungal and antibacterial activity, especially against <i>E. coli</i>, and dose-dependent antiviral activity. Rose petals EO (5%) retains low inhibitory activity against <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>S.</i> Typhimurium growth (about 20-30%), antifungal activity, and antiviral activity for medium to low virus concentrations. Rose petals extract had significant antibacterial activity at dilutions of 25-90%, especially against <i>E. coli</i> and <i>S.</i> Typhimurium, antifungal, and the most potent antiviral activity. None of the EOs and extracts were toxic in dilutions of up to 5% and 90%, respectively. Finally, all materials had a life span of more than eight weeks. These results support the aspect that rose petals and rose geranium EOs, and extracts, have beneficial antimicrobial and antiviral properties and they can be used as natural preservatives."

      "Medicinal plants represent a valuable commodity due to beneficial effects of their natural products on human health, prompting a need for finding a way to optimize/increase their production. In this study, a novel growing media with various perlite particle size and its mixture with peat moss was tested for hydroponic-based production of Echinacea purpurea medicinal plant under greenhouse conditions. The plant growth parameters such as plant height, total fresh leave weight, fresh root weight, total biomass, total chlorophyll, leaf area, and essential oil compositions were assessed. Perlite particle size in the growing media was varied from very coarse (more than 2 mm) to very fine (less than 0.5 mm), and the ratio between perlite and peat moss varied from 50:50 v/v to 30:70 v/v. In addition, two nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) to ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) ratios (90:10 and 70:30) were tested for each growing media. The medium containing very fine-grade perlite and 50:50 v/v perlite to peat moss ratio was found to be most optimal and beneficial for E. purpurea performance, resulting in maximal plant height, fresh and dry weight, leaf surface area, and chlorophyll content. It was also found that an increase in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>/NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> ratio caused a significant increase in plant growth parameters and increase the plant essential oil content. The major terpene hydrocarbons found in extract of E. purpurea with the best growth parameters were germacrene D (51%), myrcene (15%), α-pinene (12%), β-caryophyllene (11%), and 1-Pentadecene (4.4%), respectively. The percentages of these terpene hydrocarbons were increased by increasing of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>/NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> ratio. It can be concluded that decreasing the perlite particle size and increasing the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>/NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> ratio increased the plant growth parameters and essential oil compositions in E. purpurea."

      "Fungal infections remain a major health concern with aromatic plants and their metabolites standing out as promising antifungal agents. The present study aims to assess, for the first time, the antifungal and anti-inflammatory potential of <i>Bupleurum</i> subsp. <i>paniculatum</i> (Brot.) H.Wolff essential oil from Portugal. The oil obtained by hydrodistillation and characterized by GC-MS, showed high amounts of monoterpene hydrocarbons, namely α-pinene (29.0-36.0%), β-pinene (26.1-30.7%) and limonene (10.5-13.5%). The antifungal potential was assessed, according to CLSI guidelines, against several clinical and collection strains. The essential oil showed a broad fungicidal effect being more potent against <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> and dermatophytes. Moreover, a significant germ tube inhibition was observed in <i>Candida albicans</i> as well as a disruption of mature biofilms, thus pointing out an effect of the oil against relevant virulent factors. Furthermore, fungal ultrastructural modifications were detected through transmission electron microscopy, highlighting the nefarious effect of the oil. Of relevance, the oil also evidenced anti-inflammatory activity through nitric oxide inhibition in macrophages activated with lipopolysaccharide. In addition, the essential oil's bioactive concentrations did not present toxicity towards macrophages. Overall, the present study confirmed the bioactive potential of <i>B. rigidum</i> subsp. <i>paniculatum</i> essential oil, thus paving the way for the development of effective drugs presenting concomitantly antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties."

      "<i>Rhynchanthus beesianus</i> is a medicinal, ornamental, and edible plant, and its essential oil has been used as an aromatic stomachic in China. In this study, the chemical constituents, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties of flower essential oil (F-EO), leaf essential oil (L-EO), and stem essential oil (S-EO) of <i>R. beesianus</i> were investigated for the first time. According to the GC-FID/MS assay, the F-EO was mainly composed of bornyl formate (21.7%), 1,8-cineole (21.6%), borneol (9.7%), methyleugenol (7.7%), <i>β</i>-myrcene (5.4%), limonene (4.7%), camphene (4.5%), linalool (3.4%), and <i>α</i>-pinene (3.1%). The predominant components of L-EO were bornyl formate (33.9%), borneol (13.2%), 1,8-cineole (12.1%), methyleugenol (8.0%), camphene (7.8%), bornyl acetate (6.2%), and <i>α</i>-pinene (4.3%). The main components of S-EO were borneol (22.5%), 1,8-cineole (21.3%), methyleugenol (14.6%), bornyl formate (11.6%), and bornyl acetate (3.9%). For the bioactivities, the F-EO, L-EO, and S-EO exhibited significant antibacterial property against <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Proteus vulgaris</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Escherichia coli</i> with the inhibition zones (7.28-9.69 mm), MIC (3.13-12.50 mg/mL), and MBC (6.25-12.50 mg/mL). Besides, the F-EO, L-EO, and S-EO significantly inhibited the production of proinflammatory mediator nitric oxide (NO) (93.15-94.72%) and cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) (23.99-77.81%) and tumor necrosis factor-<i>α</i> (TNF-<i>α</i>) (17.69-24.93%) in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells at the dose of 128 <i>μ</i>g/mL in the absence of cytotoxicity. Hence, the essential oils of <i>R. beesianus</i> flower, leaf, and stem could be used as natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory agents with a high application potential in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic fields."

      "Fungi from the genus <i>Candida</i> are very important human and animal pathogens. Many strains can produce biofilms, which inhibit the activity of antifungal drugs and increase the tolerance or resistance to them as well. Clinically, this process leads to persistent infections and increased mortality. Today, many <i>Candida</i> species are resistant to drugs, including <i>C. auris</i>, which is a multiresistant pathogen. Natural compounds may potentially be used to combat multiresistant and biofilm-forming strains. The aim of this review was to present plant-derived preparations and compounds that inhibit <i>Candida</i> biofilm formation by at least 50%. A total of 29 essential oils and 16 plant extracts demonstrate activity against <i>Candida</i> biofilms, with the following families predominating: Lamiaceae, Myrtaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Apiacae. <i>Lavandula dentata</i> (0.045-0.07 mg/L), <i>Satureja macrosiphon</i> (0.06-8 mg/L), and <i>Ziziphora tenuior</i> (2.5 mg/L) have the best antifungal activity. High efficacy has also been observed with <i>Artemisia judaica</i>, <i>Lawsonia inermis</i>, and <i>Thymus vulgaris</i>. Moreover, 69 plant compounds demonstrate activity against <i>Candida</i> biofilms. Activity in concentrations below 16 mg/L was observed with phenolic compounds (thymol, pterostilbene, and eugenol), sesquiterpene derivatives (warburganal, polygodial, and ivalin), chalconoid (lichochalcone A), steroidal saponin (dioscin), flavonoid (baicalein), alkaloids (waltheriones), macrocyclic bisbibenzyl (riccardin D), and cannabinoid (cannabidiol). The above compounds act on biofilm formation and/or mature biofilms. In summary, plant preparations and compounds exhibit anti-biofilm activity against <i>Candida</i>. Given this, they may be a promising alternative to antifungal drugs."

      "<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of the present study was to investigate antibacterial and antibiofilm activity of a few medicinal plants against oral bacteria.<h4>Materials and methods</h4><i>Salvia officinalis</i>, <i>Lippie citriodora, Mentha piperita</i>, <i>Echinacea purpurea</i> and <i>Matricaria chamomilla</i> were extracted. Isolates from oral cavity were identified by microbiological and molecular methods. Minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration were determined by Broth microdilution method. The anti-biofilm activity of essential oils and extracts investigated and as a mixture by Broth dilution method. Toxicity of the herbal mixture was assayed by in Wistar rats treated with intradermal injection. Wound healing properties of the herbal mixture against infected wounds on the back of the rats were investigated. Anti-biofilm activity was investigated on tooth surfaces. Bacterial structure changes and fine- structure study were performed by light microscopy and Transmission electron microscopy.<h4>Results</h4>The lowest MIC and MBC for the plant mixtures was 0.0002 mg/ml belonged to <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> and the highest values (0.025 mg/ml) belonged to <i>Eikenella corrodens</i>. The essential oils of <i>S.officinalis</i>, <i>L.citriodora</i> and <i>M.piperita,</i> but not <i>E.purpurea</i> and <i>M.chamomilla</i> extracts, were able to remove the biofilms created by the studied bacteria. The herbal mixture was able to completely heal the wound skin of rats in 21 days (p<0.05 compared to control). The mixture was able to decompose the teeth biofilm in 45 seconds. The results of light and electron microscopy showed that the bacterial structure exposed to the herbal mixture was deformed.<h4>Conclusion</h4>It was concluded that the essential oils of <i>S.officinalis, L.citriodora</i> and <i>M.piperita</i> had significant effects on inhibition of oral bacteria biofilm formation."

      "Recently, increasing public concern about hygiene has been driving many studies to investigate antimicrobial and antiviral agents. However, the use of any antimicrobial agents must be limited due to their possible toxic or harmful effects. In recent years, due to previous antibiotics' lesser side effects, the use of herbal materials instead of synthetic or chemical drugs is increasing. Herbal materials are found in medicines. Herbs can be used in the form of plant extracts or as their active components. Furthermore, most of the world's populations used herbal materials due to their strong antimicrobial properties and primary healthcare benefits. For example, herbs are an excellent material to replace nanosilver as an antibiotic and antiviral agent. The use of nanosilver involves an ROS-mediated mechanism that might lead to oxidative stress-related cancer, cytotoxicity, and heart diseases. Oxidative stress further leads to increased ROS production and also delays the cellular processes involved in wound healing. Therefore, existing antibiotic drugs can be replaced with biomaterials such as herbal medicine with high antimicrobial, antiviral, and antioxidant activity. This review paper highlights the antibacterial, antiviral, and radical scavenger (antioxidant) properties of herbal materials. Antimicrobial activity, radical scavenger ability, the potential for antimicrobial, antiviral, and anticancer agents, and efficacy in eliminating bacteria and viruses and scavenging free radicals in herbal materials are discussed in this review. The presented herbal antimicrobial agents in this review include clove, portulaca, tribulus, eryngium, cinnamon, turmeric, ginger, thyme, pennyroyal, mint, fennel, chamomile, burdock, eucalyptus, primrose, lemon balm, mallow, and garlic, which are all summarized."

      "<i>Ximenia americana</i> is one of the most valuable wild edible plants in the world. In different countries, it is utilized as food, medicine, an essential oil source, and the industrial component to other products. In Ethiopia, it was one of the most known and very important plants for a long period of time. It was utilized as food, a medicinal plant, and animal feed. It was also one of the most economically important and culturally valuable plants. But nowadays, it is not adequately available in the country due to deforestation problem in the years. In addition, its economic importance, current status, and medicinal roles are not well documented and understood. As for research studies, it is concluded that unless a collective effort is taken, the existence of this plant is under severe threat and needs to have some measures. This review article is aimed at addressing the abovelined topics in detail and to pinpoint and explain the importance and status of <i>Ximenia americana</i>."

      "The major objective of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory effect of essential oil (EO) from <i>Zanthoxylum armatum</i> DC. on <i>Aspergillus flavus</i>. The chemical composition of the EO was identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of EO was investigated by liquid fermentation. The morphology, colony number, and aflatoxin content of <i>A. flavus</i> in platycladi semen were investigated by stereomicroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, plate counting, and high-performance liquid chromatography. The results indicated that the MIC of EO was 0.8 μL⋅mL<sup>-1</sup>, and the main components were β-phellandrene (7.53%), D-limonene (13.24%), linalool (41.73%), terpinen-4-ol (5.33%), and <i>trans</i>-nerolidol (6.30%). After the EO fumigated the platycladi semen, the growth of <i>A. flavus</i> slowed, and the mycelium shrank considerably. The number of colonies after EO treatment at room temperature and cold storage was significantly reduced, the inhibition effect was better under cold storage, and the aflatoxin B1 content did not exceed the standard within 100 days. Therefore, this study demonstrated the good potential of <i>A. flavus</i> growth inhibition during the storage of platycladi semen."

      "<i>Piper betle</i> (L) is a popular medicinal plant in Asia. Plant leaves have been used as a traditional medicine to treat various health conditions. It is highly abundant and inexpensive, therefore promoting further research and industrialization development, including in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Articles published from 2010 to 2020 were reviewed in detail to show recent updates on the antibacterial and antifungal properties of betel leaves. This current review showed that betel leaves extract, essential oil, preparations, and isolates could inhibit microbial growth and kill various Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as well as fungal species, including those that are multidrug-resistant and cause serious infectious diseases. <i>P. betle</i> leaves displayed high efficiency on Gram-negative bacteria such as <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, Gram-positive bacteria such as <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and <i>Candida albicans</i>. The ratio of MBC/MIC indicated bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects of <i>P. betle</i> leaves, while MFC/MIC values showed fungicidal and fungistatic effects. This review also provides a list of phytochemical compounds in betel leaves extracts and essential oils, safety profiles, and value-added products of betel leaves. Some studies also showed that the combination of betel leaves extract and essential oil with antibiotics (streptomycin, chloramphenicol and gentamicin) could provide potentiating antibacterial properties. Moreover, this review delivers a scientific resume for researchers in respected areas and manufacturers who want to develop betel leaves-based products."

      "The development of greener nano-constructs with noteworthy biological activity is of supreme interest, as a robust choice to minimize the extensive use of synthetic drugs. Essential oils (EOs) and their constituents offer medicinal potentialities because of their extensive biological activity, including the inhibition of fungi species. However, their application as natural antifungal agents are limited due to their volatility, low stability, and restricted administration routes. Nanotechnology is receiving particular attention to overcome the drawbacks of EOs such as volatility, degradation, and high sensitivity to environmental/external factors. For the aforementioned reasons, nanoencapsulation of bioactive compounds, for instance, EOs, facilitates protection and controlled-release attributes. Nanoliposomes are bilayer vesicles, at nanoscale, composed of phospholipids, and can encapsulate hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds. Considering the above critiques, herein, we report the in-house fabrication and nano-size characterization of bioactive oregano essential oil (<i>Origanum vulgare</i> L.) (OEO) molecules loaded with small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) nanoliposomes. The study was focused on three main points: (1) multi-compositional fabrication nanoliposomes using a thin film hydration-sonication method; (2) nano-size characterization using various analytical and imaging techniques; and (3) antifungal efficacy of as-developed OEO nanoliposomes against <i>Trichophyton rubrum</i> (<i>T. rubrum</i>) by performing the mycelial growth inhibition test (MGI). The mean size of the nanoliposomes was around 77.46 ± 0.66 nm and 110.4 ± 0.98 nm, polydispersity index (PdI) of 0.413 ± 0.015, zeta potential values up to -36.94 ± 0.36 mV were obtained by dynamic light scattering (DLS). and spherical morphology was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The presence of OEO into nanoliposomes was displayed by attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. Entrapment efficiency values of 79.55 ± 6.9% were achieved for OEO nanoliposomes. In vitro antifungal activity of nanoliposomes tested against <i>T. rubrum</i> strains revealed that OEO nanoliposomes exhibited the highest MGI, 81.66 ± 0.86%, at a concentration of 1.5 µL/mL compared to the rest of the formulations. In summary, this work showed that bioactive OEO molecules with loaded nanoliposomes could be used as natural antifungal agents for therapeutical purposes against <i>T. rubrum</i>."

      "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal systemic disease of felids caused by a Coronavirus (CoV) (FIPV). In spite of its clinical relevance and impact on feline health, currently the therapeutic possibilities for treatment of FIP in cats are limited. The emergence of the pandemic Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), etiological agent of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), able to infect a broad spectrum of animal species including cats, triggered the interest for the development of novel molecules with antiviral activity for treatment of CoV infections in humans and animals. Essential oils (EOs) have raised significant attention for their antiviral properties integrating and, in some cases, replacing conventional drugs. Thymus vulgaris EO (TEO) has been previously shown to be effective against several RNA viruses including CoVs. In the present study the antiviral efficacy of TEO against FIPV was evaluated in vitro. TEO at 27 μg/ml was able to inhibit virus replication with a significant reduction of 2 log10 TCID<sub>50</sub>/50 μl. Moreover, virucidal activity was tested using TEO at 27 and 270 μg/ml, over the cytotoxic threshold, determining a reduction of viral titre as high as 3.25 log10 TCID<sub>50</sub>/50 μl up to 1 h of time contact. These results open several perspectives in terms of future applications and therapeutic possibilities for coronaviruses considering that FIPV infection in cats could be a potential model for the study of antivirals against CoVs."

      "Ocimum cufodontii ((Lanza) A.J.Paton) has been traditionally used in Ethiopia against bacteria. The extracts of the leaves and roots of O. cufodontii after silica gel column chromatography furnished compounds 1-5, compounds 3 and 4 are new natural products. The oil from the hydro-distillation of the leaves, after analyzed with GC-MS, has led to the identification of β-caryophyllene as a principal component, suggesting the essential oil as medicine and spices to enhance the taste of food. The constituents of O. cufodontii were assessed for their antibacterial activity against E. coli, K. pneumonia, S. typhymurium and S. aureus. The best activity was displayed against S. aureus by the hexane extract of the roots, compound 4, and the essential oil with an inhibition zone of 17, 15, and 19 mm, respectively. Molecular docking analysis revealed that compound 1 has better docking efficiency and forms hydrophobic interactions with five amino acids (ARG192, PHE196, GLU185, GLU193, and LYS189). This suggests that the compounds may act as potential inhibitors of DNA gyrase. The constituents were also assessed for their antioxidant activities using DPPH, ferric thicyanate and ferric reducing power assay. The hexane extracts of the roots inhibited the DPPH radical and peroxide formation by 90.5 and 83%, respectively, suggesting the potential of the extract as an antioxidant. Furthermore, the hexane extract of the roots of O. cufodontii exhibited the maximum reducing power compared with the EtOAc and methanol extracts. Hence, the activity displayed herein indicated as the plant has great potential as a remedy for diseases caused by bacteria and radicals."

      "The genus <i>Stachys</i> is a member of the Lamiaceae family. These are important medicinal plants which grow all over the world and are known for their flavoring and therapeutic effects and <i>Stachys lavandulifolia</i> is an endemic species of Iran. To acquire high-quality essential oil (EO), drying technique was implemented which is an essential part of this process. The present study designed to evaluate the influences of different drying techniques (fresh sample, shade, sunlight, freeze-drying, microwave, and oven-drying (40, 60, and 80°C) on EO yield and composition of <i>S. lavandulifolia</i>. The results indicated that the maximum EO yield was obtained by the shade-drying method. The main compounds found in the fresh samples were spathulenol, myrcene, β-pinene, δ-cadinene, and α-muurolol, while spathulenol, cyrene, δ-cadinene, p-cymene, decane, α-terpinene, β-pinene, and intermedeol were found to be the dominant compounds in the dry samples. Drying techniques were found to have a significant impact on the values of the main compositions, for example, monoterpene hydrocarbons such as α-pinene, β-pinene, myrcene, and β-phellandrene were significantly reduced by microwave drying, oven-drying (40, 60, and 80°C), and sunlight-drying methods. Drying techniques increased the antioxidant activity of <i>S. lavandulifolia</i> EOs especially those acquired by freeze-drying with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values 101.8 ± 0.8 mg/ml in DPPH assay and 315.2 ± 2.1 mg/ml in decreasing power assay. As a result, shade-, sun-, and oven-drying (40°C) were found to be the most important techniques for attaining maximum yields of EO."

      "<i>Annona squamosa</i> L. (custard apple) belongs to the family Annonaceae and is an important tropical fruit cultivated in the West Indies, South and Central America, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, India, Mexico, the Bahamas, Bermuda, and Egypt. Leaves of custard apple plants have been studied for their health benefits, which are attributed to a considerable diversity of phytochemicals. These compounds include phenol-based compounds, e.g., proanthocyanidins, comprising 18 different phenolic compounds, mainly alkaloids and flavonoids. Extracts from <i>Annona squamosa</i> leaves (ASLs) have been studied for their biological activities, including anticancer, antidiabetic, antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiobesity, lipid-lowering, and hepatoprotective functions. In the current article, we discussed the nutritional and phytochemical diversity of ASLs. Additionally, ASL extracts were discussed with respect to their biological activities, which were established by in vivo and in vitro experiments. A survey of the literature based on the phytochemical profile and health-promoting effects of ASLs showed that they can be used as potential ingredients for the development of pharmaceutical drugs and functional foods. Although there are sufficient findings available from in vitro and in vivo investigations, clinical trials are still needed to determine the exact effects of ASL extracts on human health."

      "The present study was designed to assess the impact of dietary supplementation of lemongrass essential oil (LGEO) on growth performance, carcass traits, liver and kidney function, immunity, antioxidant indices and caecal microbiota of growing quail. A total of 200 Japanese quails at 1-week-old were haphazardly allotted to 5 groups of 40 chicks in five replicates (8 per replicate). The first group was the control group, while LGEO was added at levels of 150, 300, 450, and 600 mg/kg diet in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th groups, respectively. Dietary supplementation of LGEO (150, 300 and 450 mg/ kg diet) increased body weight at 3 and 5 wk of age, and increased body weight gain during all periods compared with the control group (P < 0.05). All levels of LGEO improved feed conversion ratio during the periods from 1 to 3 and 1 to 5 wk of age. During 3 to 5 wk, feed conversion ratio was improved in quails fed LGEO (300 and 450 mg/kg diet) compared with the control and other treatments. Carcass traits, plasma globulin, alanine aminotransferase, and urea values did not differ among the treatments (P > 0.05), but the activity of aspartate aminotransferase in the plasma was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in LGEO-treated groups. The total protein and albumin values were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in quails fed levels of LGEO (except 600 mg/kg diet) compared with the control. The inclusion of LGEO in quail diets improved (P < 0.05) plasma lipid profile. The dietary supplementation of LGEO increased (linear and quadratic, P < 0.05) plasma immunoglobulins (IgM, IgG, and IgA) levels, lysozyme values and activities of superoxide dismutase, total antioxidant capacity, reduced glutathione and catalase compared with the control group. The caecal Coliform, E. coli and Salmonella were lowered (P < 0.0001) in the quails treated with all LGEO levels, but the total bacterial count and Lactobacillus count were increased with dietary supplementation of LGEO levels (300 and 450 mg/kg) compared with those in the control group. The activities of digestive enzymes were significantly higher in birds fed the diet supplemented with LGEO levels than those fed the control diet. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of LGEO can improve the performance, lipid profile, immunity and antioxidant indices and decline intestinal pathogens and thus boost the health status of growing quail."

      "<i>Zingiber cassumunar</i> Roxb. (Zingiberaceae), is an important medicinal plant known as \"Plai (Phlai)\" in Thailand, \"Bangle\" in Indonesia, and \"Bulei\" in China. Traditionally, this plant has been used to treat inflammation, pain, and respiratory problems. The rhizomes are the primary part of the plant that has been used for medicinal purposes due to their constituents with therapeutic properties, including phenylbutenoids, curcuminoids, and essential oils. Since the 1970s, many studies have been conducted on the phytochemicals and bioactivities of <i>Z. cassumunar</i> to establish fundamental scientific evidence that supports its use in traditional medicine. The accumulated biological studies on the extracts, solvent fractions, and constituents of <i>Z. cassumunar</i> have described their diverse medicinal properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, neuroprotective/neurotrophic, cosmeceutical, and antifungal/antimicrobial bioactivities. In this review, we summarize information on the phytochemicals of <i>Z. cassumunar</i> and the bioactivities of its extracts and constituents."

      "Context: The use of traditional Arabic medicine (TAM) has spread to treat various diseases in Syria since ancient time. They are cost-effective with fewer side effects and are more suitable for long-term use compared with chemically synthesized medicines. <h4>Objective: </h4> We conducted ethnobotanical and ethno-medicine research on plants traditionally used as adjuvant therapy for COVID-19 symptoms in Syria. <h4>Methods: </h4>: Information was collected in the period of (September 1st, 2020 to December 21st, 2020), from Southern Region (Damascus, As Suwayda, Dar'a), Northern region (especially Aleppo), Central region (Himis, Hamah), Western coastal region (Latakia, Tartus) Eastern Region (Dayr az Zawr, Al Hasakah) in Syria. 150 informants were divided into two group one of them is pharmacists who interested in herbal remedies 73.34% (63.64% female and 36.36% male of them), and the other is herbalists 26.66% who are called \" attarin \" traditional healers and bee therapists. Medicinal plants being mentioned by the Informants were recorded with local names and photographed. Each reported medicinal plant species was gathered, compressed, dehydrated, and identified. <h4>Results: </h4>: In this research we listed a total of 26 medicinal species relating to 15 botanical families were generally utilized by pharmacists and herbalists in the prevention and treatment of COVID 19. The calculated results of medicinal use-value MUV showed that Pimpinella anisum L. was ranked first (MUV=0.933) followed by Zingiber officinale Roscoe. (MUV=0.920), then Thymus syriacus Boiss. (MUV=0.9). <h4>Conclusion: </h4> There may be some effective Syrian traditional herbal remedies in preventing and treating COVID-19 symptoms for some people, but the lack of information on the mechanism of effect, the appropriate dosage, side effects, toxicity and drug interactions makes them questionable, as they need more research and study."

      "Side effects of chemical preservatives and drug resistance have raised interest in use of herbal products. This study aimed to examine the chemical composition and antibacterial effects of <i>Cuminum cyminum</i>, <i>Mentha spicata,</i> and <i>Mentha longifolia</i> essential oils individually and in combination with sodium benzoate against methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Yersinia enterocolitica.</i> The essential oils were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Disc diffusion and microdilution assays were used for <i>in vitro</i> antimicrobial screening. The main components were cumin aldehyde, carvone, and pulegone in <i>C. cyminum</i>, <i>M. spicata,</i> and <i>M. longifolia</i> essential oils, respectively. Antibacterial data analysis showed significant differences between different antibacterial effects of essential oils individually and in combination with sodium benzoate. In terms of individual effects, antibacterial effect of <i>M. longifolia</i> and <i>C. cyminum</i> essential oils were the highest against methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>Y. enterocolitica,</i> respectively. The antibacterial effects of sodium benzoate combined with essential oils showed significant differences with the individual effect of sodium benzoate in most cases. The results indicated that the combined effect of these essential oils with sodium benzoate could reduce the use of sodium benzoate as an antimicrobial agent, which could decrease its possible side effects. Thus, for more significant effects, these essential oils could be combined with other agents for the preservation of drug and food products."

      "The present study examined the chemical composition and antimicrobial and gastrointestinal activity of the essential oils of <i>Elettaria cardamomum</i> (L.) Maton harvested in India (EC-I) and Guatemala (EC-G). Monoterpenes were present in higher concentration in EC-I (83.24%) than in EC-G (73.03%), whereas sesquiterpenes were present in a higher concentration in EC-G (18.35%) than in EC-I (9.27%). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.5 and 0.25 mg/mL were demonstrated against <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> in EC-G and EC-I, respectively, whereas MICs of 1 and 0.5 mg/mL were demonstrated against <i>Escherichia coli</i> in EC-G and EC-I, respectively. The treatment with control had the highest kill-time potential, whereas the treatment with oils had shorter kill-time. EC-I was observed to be more potent in the castor oil-induced diarrhea model than EC-G. At 100 and 200 mg/kg, P.O., EC-I exhibited 40% and 80% protection, respectively, and EC-G exhibited 20% and 60% protection, respectively, in mice, whereas loperamide (10 mg/kg, i.p., positive control) exhibited 100% protection. In the in vitro experiments, EC-I inhibited both carbachol (CCh, 1 µM) and high K<sup>+</sup> (80 mM)-induced contractions at significantly lower concentrations than EC-G. Thus, EC-I significantly inhibited <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and <i>E. coli</i> and exhibited more potent antidiarrheal and antispasmodic effects than EC-G."

      "Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonotic helminthiasis caused by different species of the genus Echinococcus, and is a major economic and public health concern worldwide. Synthetic anthelmintics are most commonly used to control CE, however, prolonged use of these drugs may result in many adverse effects. This study aims to discuss the in vitro/in vivo scolicidal efficacy of different medicinal plants and their components used against Echinococcus granulosus. Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, PubMed and Scopus were used to retrieve the published literature from 2000-2020. A total of 62 published articles met the eligibility criteria and were reviewed. A total of 52 plant species belonging to 22 families have been reported to be evaluated as scolicidal agents against E. granulosus worldwide. Most extensively used medicinal plants against E. granulosus belong to the family Lamiaceae (25.0%) followed by Apiaceae (11.3%). Among various plant parts, leaves (36.0%) were most commonly used. Essential oils of Zataria multiflora and Ferula asafetida at a concentration of 0.02, and 0.06 mg/ml showed 100% in vitro scolicidal activity after 10 min post application, respectively. Z. multiflora also depicted high in vivo efficacy by decreasing weight and size while also causing extensive damage to the germinal layer of the cysts. Plant-based compounds like berberine, thymol, and thymoquinone have shown high efficacy against E. granulosus. These plant species and compounds could be potentially used for the development of an effective drug against E. granulosus, if further investigated for in vivo efficacy, toxicity, and mechanism of drug action in future research."

      "<i>Thymus</i> (Lamiaceae) is famous for its pharmacological properties. <i>Thymus daenensis</i> Celak (Avishan-e-denaee in Persian) is an endemic <i>Thymus</i> species in Iran and is traditionally used for its digestive, carminative, antitussive, antispasmodic, and expectorant attributes in folk medicine. Ecotypic oils were extracted and analyzed with the GC-MS. Their biological properties in terms of antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antigenotoxic activities were evaluated using the minimal inhibitory concentration, minimal bactericidal concentration, and DPPH, <i>β</i>-carotene, and comet assays. The GC-MS results for <i>Thymus daenensis</i> Celak oils revealed thymol (73.86%) and carvacrol (51.89%) as the most abundant components. Due to the results, reasonable bactericidal activity values range from 0.14 to 5.00 mg/ml, and fungicidal activity ranges from 0.17 to 0.58 mg/ml. The necessary oil free radical scavenging capacity (0.41-1.79 mg/ml), bleaching inhibitory activity (0.01-1.06 mg/ml), and genoprotective potential (1.04-7.78 mg/ml) indicated the dose-dependent activity. The results suggest that <i>Thymus daenensis</i> is an important antibacterial and antifungal bioresource. Additionally, the antioxidant and radical scavenging capacity suggests this species has a role as a natural preservative in oxidative diseases and in the prevention of food spoilage."

      "The genus Thymus is traditionally used for the treatment of hyperactive airways complaints. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the potential tracheal relaxant effect and possible mechanism(s) of the essential oil of <i>Thymus serrulatus</i> (TS Oil) in isolated guinea pig tracheal tissues. The essential oil was obtained from the fresh erial parts of <i>Thymus serrulatus</i>, and its phyto-components were identified by GC-MS analysis. Guinea pig tracheal preparations were used for testing the tracheal relaxant effect of TS Oil with the determination of the mechanism(s) involved in this relaxation. GC-MS findings reveal that terpenes, fragrance constituents, saponins, and higher fatty acids are present in TS Oil. In isolated guinea pig trachea, TS Oil inhibited carbachol (CCh, 1 µM) and K<sup>+</sup> (80 mM)-induced contractions in a pattern similar to that of dicyclomine. TS Oil, at 0.3 mg/ml, shifted parallel CCh-curves towards the right, followed by a non-parallel shift at higher concentration (1 mg/ml), thus suppressing maximum response in the same manner as produced by dicyclomine. Pretreatment of tissues with TS Oil (1 and 3 mg/ml) also produced a rightward shift of Ca<sup>++</sup> concentration-response curves (CRCs) in the same manner as caused by verapamil. Further, TS Oil at low concentrations (0.3 and 1 mg/ml) shifted isoprenaline-induced inhibitory CRCs towards the left and increased cAMP levels in isolated tracheal homogenates similar to papaverine, a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor. In the antimicrobial assay performed by the agar well diffusion method, TS Oil was found most active against <i>Candida albicans</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> where the zone of inhibition measured was 28 mm. Additionally, there was little difference between standard strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. However, methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA) showed a small zone of inhibition as compared to standard strains (22 mm). From these results, it can be concluded that the essential oil of <i>T. serrulatus</i> has the potential to produce antimicrobial effects while causing tracheal relaxation mediated possibly by anticholinergic effects, Ca<sup>++</sup> channel blockade, and PDE inhibition whereas additional mechanism(s) cannot be ruled out."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Plants are the repository of variable number of valuable secondary metabolites that bears pharmacognostic and pharmacological implications having potentiality to emerge as super drugs in future. In-vivo production of these metabolites is influenced by the biotic and abiotic stresses resulting in continuous accumulation of diverse phytochemicals and their derivatives that can be useful in designing and developing potential drugs for future. The aim of the present study is to review the existence of medicinally important secondary metabolites and possible pharmacological and pharmacognostic importance of under-explored weed plant species <i>Hyptis suaveolens</i> (L.) Poit., to explore the potentiality of the plant for developing and designing the drugs for future.<h4>Main body of the abstract</h4><i>Hyptis suaveolens</i> belonging to family Lamiaceae is the rich source of medicinally important phytochemicals like essential oils, tannins, saponins, phenols, flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, and sterols. One or many of these compounds have antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, anti-septic, anti-cancer, anti-ulcer, antimicrobial, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, anti-diabetic, anti-fertility, diaphoretics, anticutaneous, anticatarrhal, antirheumatic, anti-ulcer, gastroprotective, immunomodulatory, analgesic, and antiviral activity.<h4>Short conclusion</h4><i>Hyptis suaveolens</i> contains unique terpenoid metabolites like suaveolic acid, suaveolol, methyl suaveolate, beta-sitosterol, ursolic acid, and phenolic compound like rosamarinic acid, methyl rosamarinate that have potentiality to substitute the traditional drugs as therapeutic agent against the resistant and newly emerged bacterial and viral pathogens. Pentacyclic triterpenoid, ursolic acid have been reported to have effective antiviral response against the SARS-CoV2 responsible for the present COVID-19 pandemic and HIV virus for which no effective vaccines are available till date. Ursolic acid has the ability to modulate the activity of main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) that is essential for processing of SARS-CoV2 replicase-transcriptase machinery needed for viral replication and particle assembly."

      "<h4>Objective</h4>The objective of this study was to compare <i>in vitro</i> the antifungal efficacy of the essential oil of <i>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</i> (Canela) (EOC) at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% against strains of <i>Candida albicans</i> ATCC 10231.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The design was experimental, <i>in vitro</i>, prospective, and longitudinal study, having a sample of <i>n</i> = 30 petri dishes per six groups. The test was conducted in the microbiology laboratory of the <i>Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal</i>. The essential oil was prepared by steam distillation, which means that the pressure steam enters in connection with the plant cells and breaks them, releasing the essence and trapping it in drops of water. Cinnamon essential oil was obtained using the hydrodistillation method, subsequently the oil obtained was dehydrated with sodium sulfate and then filtered at 0.22 µm. Then the vials were stored at a temperature of 4°C. Finally, <i>Candida albicans</i> ATCC 10231 was used as the biological material. Antifungal efficacy was measured by the Kirby-Bauer method (disk diffusion).<h4>Results</h4>It was found that in the 24-h group the concentration that had the greatest antifungal effect was 100% EOC with a mean of 22.1 ± 11 mm; however, the lowest antifungal activity was seen in the 25% EOC with 17.9 ± 1.6 mm. On the contrary, in the 48-h group, it was shown that the highest antifungal efficacy was also observed in the 100% EOC with an average of 31.2 ± 3.2 mm, but the lowest antifungal activity was in the 25% EOC with 22.6 ± 1.7 mm. Although in both groups, both at 24 and 48h, nystatin was the one with the lowest antifungal efficacy 15.1 ± 1.0 and 19.9 ± 0.1 mm, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>EOC had a better statistically significant antifungal effect compared to nystatin. Otherwise, on analysis of the results in different concentrations, the EOC showed a directly proportional antifungal effectiveness as the concentration against the strains of <i>C. albicans</i> ATCC 10231 increased, compared to nystatin, suggesting its potential use as a possible attractive therapeutic alternative for the control of diseases caused by strains of <i>C. albicans</i> resistant to nystatin."

      "In this study, the anxiolytic activity of <i>Piper nigrum</i> essential oil (PNEO) was evaluated in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and the antidepressant-like effect was evaluated through tail suspension test (TST) in mice. Flumazenil, a competitive inhibitor of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor in the benzodiazepine site and WAY-100635 maleate salt, a 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor antagonist were used to find out the possible mechanism(s) of action of PNEO. To exclude the false-positive results due to the enhancement of the locomotor activity, the animals were submitted to open field test (OFT). We also measured monoamines levels of the mice brain after acute PNEO treatment. The data obtained from the study suggest that the anxiolytics and antidepressant-like effect of PNEO have observed in EPM and TST respectively in a dose-dependent manner after oral acute and repetitive treatment. WAY-100635, but not flumazenil was able to reverse the effect of PNEO in EPM and TST both, indicating the possible involvement of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor. The neurochemical analysis showed no alteration in monoamine levels in mice brains. Furthermore, no locomotor impairment or sign of toxicity or changes in body weight or abnormalities in the biochemical parameters, except for a significant decrease in total cholesterol level was observed after treatment with PNEO. The findings suggest that <i>Piper nigrum</i> EO possesses a dual anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effect through the possible involvement of serotonergic transmission."

      "<i>Mentha</i> species are widely used as food, medicine, spices, and flavoring agents. Thus, chemical composition is an important parameter for assessing the quality of mints. In general, the contents of menthol, menthone, eucalyptol, and limonene comprise one of the major parameters for assessing the quality of commercially important mints. Building further on the phytochemical characterization of the quality of <i>Mentha</i> species, this work was focused on the composition of phenolic compounds in methanolic extracts. Thirteen <i>Mentha</i> species were grown under the same environmental conditions, and their methanolic extracts were subjected to the LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) profiling of phenolics and the testing their biological activities, i.e., antioxidant and tyrosinase inhibition activities, which are important features for the cosmetic industry. The total phenolic content (TPC) ranged from 14.81 ± 1.09 mg GAE (gallic acid equivalents)/g for <i>Mentha cervina</i> to 58.93. ± 8.39 mg GAE/g for <i>Mentha suaveolens</i>. The antioxidant activity of examined <i>Mentha</i> related with the content of the phenolic compounds and ranged from 22.79 ± 1.85 to 106.04 ± 3.26 mg TE (Trolox equivalents)/g for <i>M. cervina</i> and <i>Mentha x villosa</i>, respectively. Additionally, <i>Mentha pulegium</i> (123.89 ± 5.64 mg KAE (kojic acid equivalents)/g) and <i>Mentha x piperita</i> (102.82 ± 15.16 mg KAE/g) showed a strong inhibition of the enzyme tyrosinase, which is related to skin hyperpigmentation. The most abundant compound in all samples was rosmarinic acid, ranging from 1363.38 ± 8323 to 2557.08 ± 64.21 μg/g. In general, the levels of phenolic acids in all examined mint extracts did not significantly differ. On the contrary, the levels of flavonoids varied within the species, especially in the case of hesperidin (from 0.73 ± 0.02 to 109. 39 ± 2.01 μg/g), luteolin (from 1.84 ± 0.11 to 31.03 ± 0.16 μg/g), and kaempferol (from 1.30 ± 0.17 to 33.68 ± 0.81 μg/g). Overall results indicated that all examined mints possess significant amounts of phenolic compounds that are responsible for antioxidant activity and, to some extent, for tyrosinase inhibition activity. Phenolics also proved to be adequate compounds, together with terpenoids, for the characterization of <i>Mentha</i> sp. Additionally, citrus-scented <i>Mentha</i> x <i>villosa</i> could be selected as a good candidate for the food and pharmaceutical industry, especially due its chemical composition and easy cultivation, even in winter continental conditions."

      "The species <i>Chiliadenus glutinosus</i> (L.) Fourr. has a large number of therapeutic uses reported in the traditional Spanish medicine. The growing interest in preserving the ethnopharmacological knowledge related to the botanical diversity existing in Spain and the interest in achieving scientific validation of the therapeutic properties of medicinal species has led to the development of this study. To do it, all the known medicinal uses of <i>Ch. glutinosus</i> in Spain were compiled, then an exhaustive bibliographic research on its chemical composition was carried out, and finally, an in silico validation of the bioactive phytochemicals present in a higher proportion in the essential oil of <i>Ch. glutinosus</i>: camphor, borneol, lucinone, glutinone, quercetin, kutdtriol, and kaempferol; in an attempt to justify the reported traditional uses of the species. It was found that much of the traditional medicinal uses of <i>Ch. glutinosus</i>, along with the biological activity of its phytochemicals, are supported by scientific evidence. The results place this species in a prominent position to initiate possible lines of research to develop new, more effective drugs and improve therapies to treat conditions and diseases that affect the different organic systems of the human being."

      "The aim of this study was to detect effects of bitter orange (<i>Citrus aurantium</i>) essential oil, commonly called neroli oil (NO) (0, 0.25, 0.50, 1, and 1.5% referred to as NO<sub>0</sub> NO<sub>0.25</sub>, NO<sub>0. 05</sub>, NO<sub>1</sub> and NO<sub>1.5</sub>, respectively) on growth performance output and expression levels of some growth-related genes in the muscle tissue and some immune-related genes in the head kidney and pathological differences in digestive system organs of common carp <i>Cyprinus carpio</i>. The NO<sub>0.25</sub> group had a large improvement in growth efficiency at the end of the 60-day feeding cycle. Real-time PCR (Bio RAD, USA) system was used to detect variations in gene expression levels. Furthermore, NO supplementation of up to 0.25% in muscle tissue controlled the release of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). Furthermore, in the NO<sub>0.25</sub> treatment category, immune response gene levels TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-1ß increased in head kidney tissue. In the histological examination of the liver and intestine, there were significant differences between fish fed with N<sub>1</sub> and N<sub>1.5</sub> diets. This study confirms that dietary supplementation of NO up to 0.25% can improve common carp growth efficiency and increase the expression of genes (GH and IGF-I) related to muscle growth, TNF-α, IL-8 and IL-1ß genes related to immune status, and liver and intestine histological status of common carp."

      "Mānuka oil is an essential oil derived from <i>Leptospermum scoparium</i>, a plant that has been used by the indigenous populations of New Zealand and Australia for centuries. Both the extracted oil and its individual components have been associated with various medicinal properties. Given the rise in resistance to conventional antibiotics, natural products have been targeted for the development of antimicrobials with novel mechanism of action. This review aimed to collate available evidence on the antimicrobial, anti-parasitic and anti-inflammatory activities of mānuka oil and its components. A comprehensive literature search of was conducted using PubMed and Embase (via Scopus) targeting articles from database inception until June 2020. Chemical structures and IUPAC names were sourced from PubChem. Unpublished information from grey literature databases, Google search, targeted websites and Google Patents were also included. The present review found extensive in vitro data supporting the antimicrobial effects of mānuka oil warrants further clinical studies to establish its therapeutic potential. Clinical evidence on its efficacy, safety and dosing guidelines are necessary for its implementation for medical purposes. Further work on regulation, standardization and characterization of the medicinal properties of mānuka oil is required for establishing consistent efficacy of the product."

      "The Lamiaceae family is an important source of species among medicinal plants highly valued for their biological properties and numerous uses in folk medicine. <i>Origanum</i> is one of the main genera that belong to this family. The purpose of the study was to determine the phenolic composition of the <i>Origanum vulgare</i> extract and evaluate the antimicrobial, antioxidant, and inhibitory activities of this species that grows in the Andean region of the Atacama Desert. High-performance liquid chromatography was performed to determine the main phenols. Rosmarinic acid was identified as the predominant phenolic compound in this species (76.01 mg/100 g DW), followed by protocatechuic acid, which to our knowledge, no previous study reported similar concentrations in <i>O. vulgare</i>. The oregano extract exhibited a content of total phenolic (3948 mg GAE/100 g DW) and total flavonoid (593 mg QE/100 g DW) with a higher DPPH antioxidant activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 40.58 µg/mL), compared to the same species grown under other conditions. Furthermore, it was found to inhibit α-glucosidase activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> value (7.11 mg/mL) lower than acarbose (129.32 mg/mL). <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and <i>Pantoea agglomerans</i> (both MIC 0.313 mg/mL and MBC 1.25 mg/mL) were the bacteria most susceptible to oregano extract with the lowest concentration necessary to inhibit bacterial growth. These results open the door for the potential use of this plant to manage chronic diseases, and they expand the knowledge of the species cultivated in arid environmental conditions."

      "Ocimum basilicum essential oil (EO) was evaluated for its biological effects on M. domestica. Characterization of O. basilicum EO revealed the presence of methyl chavicol (70.93%), linalool (9.34%), epi-α-cadinol (3.69 %), methyl eugenol (2.48%), γ-cadinene (1.67%), 1,8-cineole (1.30%) and (E)-β-ocimene (1.11%). The basil EO and its constituents methyl chavicol and linalool elicited a neuronal response in female adults of M. domestica. Adult female flies showed reduced preference to food source laced with basil EO and methyl chavicol. Substrates treated with EO and methyl chavicol at 0.25% resulted in an oviposition deterrence of over 80%. A large ovicidal effect was found for O. basilicum EO (EC<sub>50</sub> 9.74 mg/dm<sup>3</sup>) followed by methyl chavicol (EC<sub>50</sub> 10.67 mg/dm<sup>3</sup>) and linalool (EC<sub>50</sub> 13.57 mg/dm<sup>3</sup>). Adults exposed to EO (LD<sub>50</sub> 10.01 μg/adult) were more susceptible to contact toxicity than to methyl chavicol and linalool (LD<sub>50</sub> 13.62 μg/adult and LD<sub>50</sub> 43.12 μg/adult respectively). EO and its constituents methyl chavicol and linalool also induced the detoxifying enzymes Carboxyl esterase (Car E) and Glutathione S - transferases (GST)."

      "<i>Euphorbia</i> species have a large spectrum of traditional medicinal uses. We tested the biological activities of the essential oil (EO) of <i>Euphorbia intisy</i> Drake in an acquired multidrug resistance leukemia model to assess whether the EO obtained by hydrodistillation of stems was able to reverse the resistant phenotype. HL-60R cell lines are characterized by the overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and constitutive expression of NF-κB. EO chemical composition was determined by GC/MS analysis; cytotoxic activity of EO by MTS assay alone or in combination with doxorubicin; pro-apoptotic effect and doxorubicin accumulation were analyzed by flow cytometry; P-gp ATPase activity was measured by P-gp-Glo™ assay systems kit. The ability to inhibit NF-κB and its target genes was also assessed. <i>E. intisy</i> EO exhibited a comparable cytotoxic effect and ability to block P-gp in both the HL-60 and its MDR variant HL-60R. In addition, EO suppressed P-gp protein expression and significantly downregulated MDR1 mRNA level, as well as some IAPs proteins, probably through the inhibition of NF-κB. Our results suggest that <i>E. intisy</i> EO could reverse P-gp-mediated drug resistance in tumor cells acting as a chemosensitizing agent."

      "<i>Aniba rosaeodora</i> is one of the most widely used plants in the perfumery industry, being used as medicinal plant in the Brazilian Amazon. This work aimed to evaluate the chemical composition of <i>A. rosaeodora</i> essential oil and its biological activities. <i>A. rosaeodora</i> essential oil presented linalool (93.60%) as its major compound. The <i>A. rosaeodora</i> essential oil and linalool showed activity against all the bacteria strains tested, standard strains and marine environment bacteria, with the lower minimum inhibitory concentration being observed for <i>S. aureus</i>. An efficient antioxidant activity of <i>A. rosaeodora</i> essential oil and linalool (EC<sub>50</sub>: 15.46 and 6.78 µg/mL, respectively) was evidenced by the inhibition of the 2,2-azinobis- (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical. The antitrypanosomal activity of <i>A. rosaeodora</i> essential oil and linalool was observed at high concentrations against epimatigote forms (inhibitory concentration for 50% of parasites (IC<sub>50</sub>): 150.5 ± 1.08 and 198.6 ± 1.12 µg/mL, respectively), and even higher against intracellular amastigotes of <i>T. cruzi</i> (IC<sub>50</sub>: 911.6 ± 1.15 and 249.6 ± 1.18 µg/mL, respectively). Both <i>A. rosaeodora</i> essential oil and linalool did not exhibit a cytotoxic effect in BALB/c peritoneal macrophages, and both reduced nitrite levels in unstimulated cells revealing a potential effect in NO production. These data revealed the pharmacological potential of <i>A. rosaeodora</i> essential oil and linalool, encouraging further studies."

      "Essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation of <i>Montanoa quadrangularis</i> leaves, flowers, and stems were analyzed by GC and GC/MS techniques revealing myrcene, limonene, β-phellandrene, and sabinene among the main components. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the MDR modulator activity on human MDR1 gene transfected mouse lymphoma cell line and the antimicrobial activity on the essential oils obtained from different parts of the species under investigation. The results revealed that MQL caused a similar increase in the fluorescence activity of the cells at 0.02 μL/mL comparing to the Verapamil<sup>®</sup> value. The antimicrobial assay was carried out according to the disc diffusion method. Five different bacterial strains (<i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i>, <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i> AG 100, and <i>Escherichia coli</i> AG100A) were treated with the essential oils and the zones of inhibition were determined on TSA plates and TSA agar plates supplemented with Tween 20. MQF and MQL showed activity against <i>B. subtilis</i>, <i>S. epidermidis</i>, and <i>E. coli</i> AG 100A while MQS was only active against <i>E. coli</i> AG 100A on TSA agar plates experiment. In case of TSA agar plates supplemented with 0.1 <i>v</i>/<i>v</i>% Tween 20 detergent, MQF showed inhibition on <i>B. subtilis</i>, <i>S. epidermidis</i>, and <i>E. coli</i> AG 100A; MQL was active against <i>B. subtilis</i>, <i>E. coli</i> AG 100, <i>and E. coli</i> AG 100A while MQS was only active against <i>E. coli</i> AG 100A."

      "<i>Momordica</i> species (Family Cucurbitaceae) are cultivated throughout the world for their edible fruits, leaves, shoots and seeds. Among the species of the genus <i>Momordica,</i> there are three selected species that are used as vegetable, and for medicinal purposes, <i>Momordica charantia</i> L (Bitter melon), <i>Momordica foetida</i> Schumach (Bitter cucumber) and <i>Momordica balsamina</i> L (African pumpkin). The fruits and leaves of these <i>Momordica</i> species are rich in primary and secondary metabolites such as proteins, fibers, minerals (calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc), <i>β</i>-carotene, foliate, ascorbic acid, among others. The extracts from <i>Momordica</i> species are used for the treatment of a variety of diseases and ailments in traditional medicine. <i>Momordica</i> species extracts are reputed to possess anti-diabetic, anti-microbial, anthelmintic bioactivity, abortifacient, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and play chemo-preventive functions. In this review we summarize the biochemical, nutritional, and medicinal values of three <i>Momordica</i> species (<i>M. charantia</i>, <i>M. foetida</i> and <i>M. balsamina</i>) as promising and innovative sources of natural bioactive compounds for future pharmaceutical usage."

      "<i>Cinnamomum</i> plants (Lauraceae) are a woody species native to South and Southeast Asia forests, and are widely used as food flavors and traditional medicines. This study aims to evaluate the chemical constituents of <i>Cinnamomum osmophloeum</i> ct. linalool leaf oil, and its antidepressant and motor coordination activities and the other behavioral evaluations in a rodent animal model. The major component of leaf oil is linalool, confirmed by GC-MS analysis. Leaf oil would not induce the extra body weight gain compared to the control mice at the examined doses after 6 weeks of oral administration. The present results provide the first evidence for motor coordination and antidepressant effects present in leaf oil. According to hypnotic, locomotor behavioral, and motor coordination evaluations, leaf oil would not cause side effects, including weight gain, drowsiness and a diminishment in the motor functions, at the examined doses. In summary, these results revealed <i>C. osmophloeum</i> ct. linalool leaf essential oil is of high potential as a therapeutic supplement for minor/medium depressive syndromes."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Different effects of cinnamon and its oil in traditional medicine in the treatment of diseases, including gastrointestinal diseases, were reported. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cinnamon oil (<i>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</i>) in patients with functional dyspepsia in a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial.<h4>Methods</h4>Soft gelatin capsule was made using the rotary die process, and the final capsule was standardized based on its cinnamaldehyde amount and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Sixty-four patients with symptomatic functional dyspepsia were randomized to receive cinnamon oil soft capsule (<i>n</i> = 29) or sesame oil soft capsule as placebo (<i>n</i> = 35) for 6 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was the sum score of the patient's gastrointestinal symptom (five-point scale). Secondary variables were the scores of each dyspeptic symptom including severity of vomiting, sickness, nausea, bloating, abdominal cramps, early satiety, acidic eructation/heartburn, loss of appetite, retrosternal discomfort, and epigastric pain/upper abdominal pain, as well as any reported adverse events.<h4>Results</h4>The results showed that, after 6 weeks of treatment, the cinnamon oil and placebo groups significantly decreased the total dyspepsia score compared to the baseline at the endpoint (<i>P</i> < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference between the cinnamon oil and placebo groups in terms of the baseline and endpoint values of the outcome variables (<i>P</i>=0.317 and <i>P</i>=0.174, respectively). Two patients in the cinnamon oil group complained of rashes, and three patients in the placebo group complained of nausea.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study showed significant improvements in gastrointestinal symptom score in both treatment and placebo groups. However, there was no significant difference between the cinnamon oil and sesame oil groups in terms of the baseline and endpoint values of the outcome variables. This study was registered as https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/IRCT20170802035460N2, 29 December 2017, in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials with https://www.IRCT.ir."

      "Development of bactericides and fungicides in terms of isolation and identification of substances is an important area of research. Presently, under the concept of integrated pest management, all possible plant pest and disease control methods are integrated to minimize the excessive use of synthetic chemicals and also the incidence of disease. The potential of various essential oils against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi is being actively investigated in various laboratories across the world. Rice the most important crop, suffers from huge yield losses due to blast and blight diseases. Most of the labs have focussed to use transgenic approaches, the use of environmentally friendly natural products, as disease control strategies. In this context, we propose to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of essential oils and their ability to control diseases of rice. Seven Essential oils from seven different plants were selected for the study. The antimicrobial activity was assessed in terms of their antibacterial activity towards non-pathogenic bacteria and pathogenic drug resistant bacteria by means of their ability to sensitize the drug resistant bacteria in plasmid curing and, ß-lactamase inhibition and as antifungal agents. In conclusion, out of the seven essential oils used, lemongrass, palm rosa and eucalyptus were found to be good antimicrobial agents."

      "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a gradually growing irreversible illness of the brain that almost affects every fifth person (aged > 80 years) in the world. World Health Organization (WHO) also revealed that the prevalence of this disease will enhance (upto double) significantly upto 2030. The poor cholinergic transmission at the synapse is considered to be one of the main reasons behind the progression and occurrence of this disorder. Natural inhibitors of acetylcholine (ACh) such as galanthamine and rivastigmine are used commercially in the treatmentof AD. The biomolecules such assesquiterpenes, possess a great structural diversity and are responsible for a plethora of pharmacological properties. The potential of various sesquiterpenes as anticholinesterase has been reviewed in this article. For this purpose, the various databases, mainly PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were investigatedwith different keywords such as \"sesquiterpenes+acetylcholinesterase\" and \"sesquiterpenes+cholinesterase+inhibitors\" in the surveyed time frame (2010-2020). A vast literature was evident in the last decade, which affirms the potential of various sesquiterpenes in the improvement of cholinergic transmission by inhibiting the AChE. After data analysis, it was found that 12 compounds out of a total of 58 sesquiterpenes were reported to possess IC<sub>50</sub> < 9μM and can be considered as potential candidates for the improvement of learning and memory. Sesquiterpene is an important category of terpenoids, found to possess a large spectrum of biological activities. The outcome of the review clearly states that sesquiterpenes (such as amberboin, lipidiol,etc) from herbs could offer fresh, functional compounds for possible prevention and treatment of AD."

      "Asarum heterotropoides Fr. var. mandshuricum (Maxim) Kitag (Chinese wild ginger) is an important medicinal herb. Essential oil extracted from its roots is the key ingredient and is mainly composed of phenylpropanoid compounds. As a skiophyte plant, light is a crucial factor for A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum growth and metabolism. To investigate the effects of light irradiation on the essential oil biosynthesis in A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum, the plants were cultivated in four light irradiation treatments (100, 50, 24 and 12% full sunlight). The photosynthetic capacity, essential oil content and composition, activities of several enzymes and levels of some secondary metabolites involved in the shikimic acid and cinnamic acid pathways were analyzed. The leaf mass per area, average diurnal net photosynthetic rate, and the essential oil content increased significantly with increasing light intensity. Phenylalanine, cinnamic acid, and p-coumaric acid in the cinnamic acid pathway were at their highest levels in plants cultivated in 100% full sunlight. The highest content of shikimic acid in the shikimic acid pathway was obtained in plants grown in 50% sunlight transmittance. The activity of the enzymes 3-Deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase and 4-coumarate:CoA ligase increased proportionally with light intensity. Overall, we conclude that high light irradiation promotes high net photosynthetic rate, high activity of enzymes and high amounts of phenylpropanoid precursor metabolites leading to significant biosynthesis of essential oil in A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum."

      "The coastal and subcoastal areas of west-central Morocco (Safi to Draa River, the Souss Valley, and the southern part of the western High Atlas and northern and southern slopes of the western Anti-Atlas) are characterized by typical Infra-Mediterranean vegetation ranking them amongst the important of the remarkable borderlands of North Africa. The flora is determined by complex historical and environmental factors occurring since the Tertiary period. The originality of this sector is due to the presence of the argan tree (Argania spinosa (L.) Skeels), Moroccan gum (Acacia gummifera Willd), olive trees (Olea europaea L. subsp. maroccana (Greuter & Burdet) P. Vargas & al.), a thermophilic flora adapted to an arid climate with several endemic species. This flora constitutes the final barrier against the desert and is of environmental and socioeconomical interest. Leaves and fruits provide forage material, while wood is used for fuel. Argan fruits are collected for their oily constitutes and for nutritional, cosmetic, and medicinal properties. Additionally, many species of Argan ecosystems are used in medicine and cosmetics. Recognizing its ecological value and local economic importance, the Argan region was declared a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1998. Despite their biogeographical, historical, and socioeconomic value, vegetation structures in west-central Morocco are vulnerable and threatened by human activities. They exhibit high levels of degradation due to increasing clearance, overgrazing, and overexploitation. The area requires high conservation priority and sustainable management strategies for key species and genetic diversity."

      "<i>Syzygium aromaticum</i> has a diversity of biological activities due to the chemical compounds found in its plant products such as total phenolic compounds and flavonoids. The present work describes the chemical analysis and antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antitrypanosomal activity of the essential oil of <i>S. aromaticum</i>. Eugenol (53.23%) as the major compound was verified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. <i>S. aromaticum</i> essential oil was more effective against <i>S. aureus</i> (MIC 50 <i>μ</i>g/mL) than eugenol (MIC 250 <i>μ</i>g/mL). Eugenol presented higher antioxidant activity than <i>S. aromaticum</i> essential oil, with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 12.66 and 78.98 <i>µ</i>g/mL, respectively. <i>S. aromaticum</i> essential oil and eugenol exhibited <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> inhibitory activity, with IC<sub>50</sub> of 28.68 ± 1.073 and 31.97 ± 1.061 <i>μ</i>g/mL against epimastigotes and IC<sub>50</sub> of 64.51 ± 1.658 and 45.73 ± 1.252 <i>μ</i>g/mL against intracellular amastigotes, respectively. Both compounds presented low cytotoxicity, with <i>S. aromaticum</i> essential oil displaying 15.5-fold greater selectivity for the parasite than the cells. Nitrite levels in <i>T. cruzi</i>-stimulated cells were reduced by essential oil (47.01%; <i>p</i> = 0.002) and eugenol (48.05%; <i>p</i> = 0.003) treatment. The trypanocidal activity of <i>S. aromaticum</i> essential oil showed that it is reasonable to use it in future research in the search for new therapeutic alternatives for trypanosomiasis."

      "<h4>Background</h4><i>Echinops kebericho</i> is an endemic medicinal plant in Ethiopia widely used in the treatment of infectious and noninfectious diseases. Essential oils are known for their antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, insecticidal, and antioxidant properties. This study evaluated the antifungal activity of essential oil from <i>E. kebericho</i> against four common pathogenic fungi and two standard strains.<h4>Methods</h4>The essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation. The antifungal screening was done by agar well diffusion method. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution. Minimal fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were determined by subculturing fungal strains with no visible growth onto a Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) plate.<h4>Results</h4><i>Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans</i> were highly sensitive while <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> did not show sensitivity up to 1 mg/ml of essential oil; MICs ranged from 0.083 mg/ml to 0.208 mg/ml. Concentration and fungal species showed significant dose-dependent associations (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) with antifungal activity. The MICs of essential oil were comparable to those of the standard drug (fluconazole) against <i>C. glabrata</i> and <i>C. krusei.</i> The lowest MFC of the essential oil was observed against <i>Candida parapsilosis</i> (0.145 mg/ml) while the highest MFC was against <i>Candida krusei</i> (0.667 mg/ml).<h4>Conclusion</h4><i>Echinops kebericho</i> essential oil showed noteworthy antifungal activity against <i>Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans</i>, and <i>Candida glabrata</i> and could be a potential candidate for further antifungal drug development."

      "<h4>Background</h4>Today, the present protoscolicidals used to minimize the serious risks during hydatid cyst surgery are not completely safe and have various adverse side effects. The present study aimed to evaluate the chemical composition and apoptotic activity of <i>Ferula macrecolea</i> essential oil (FMEO) as well as its in vitro and ex vivo protoscolicidal effects against hydatid cyst protoscoleces.<h4>Methods</h4>Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis was performed to determine the chemical composition of FMEO. Protoscoleces of hydatid cysts were collected from liver fertile hydatid cysts of infected sheep and were then treated with various concentrations of the essential oil (75, 150, and 300 µL/mL) for 5-60 min in vitro and ex vivo. Then, by using the eosin exclusion test, the viability of the protoscoleces was studied. The caspase-3-like activity of the FMEO-treated protoscoleces was also evaluated through the colorimetric protease assay Sigma Kit based on the manufacturer's instructions.<h4>Results</h4>According to GC/MS, the main constituents of the essential oil were terpinolene (77.72%), n-nonanal (4.47%), and linalool (4.35%), respectively. In vitro, the maximum protoscolicidal activity of FMEO was observed at the concentrations of 150 and 300 µL/mL, such that 100% of the protoscoleces were killed after 30 and 20 min of exposure, respectively. Based on the obtained findings, the results demonstrate that FMEO required a longer time to kill protoscoleces ex vivo; after 12 min of exposure to FMEO, only 13.4% of the protoscoleces remained alive. After 48 h of the treatment of protoscoleces, FMEO, in a dose-dependent manner and at doses of 75, 150, and 300 µL/mL, induced the activation of the caspase enzyme by 24.3, 35.3, and 48.3%, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings demonstrate the potent protoscolicidal effects of FMEO in vitro and ex vivo; however, further studies are required to assess the safety and the efficiency of FMEO as a promising scolicidal agent in a preclinical model and clinical setting."

      "Spontaneous emissions of <i>S. dentata</i> Aiton and <i>S. scabra</i> Thunb., as well as the essential oil (EO) composition of the cited species, together with <i>S. aurea</i> L., were investigated. The chemical profile of the first two species is reported here for the first time. Moreover, in vitro tests were performed to evaluate the antifungal activity of these EOs on <i>Trichophyton mentagrophytes</i>, <i>Microsporum canis</i>, <i>Aspergillus flavus</i>, <i>Aspergillus niger</i>, and <i>Fusarium solani</i>. Secondly, the EO antibacterial activity against <i>Escherichia coli,</i>&nbsp;<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and <i>Staphylococcus pseudointermedius</i> was examined, and their antiviral efficacy against the H1N1 influenza virus was assessed. Leaf volatile organic compounds (VOCs), as well as the EOs obtained from the arial part of <i>Salvia</i>&nbsp;<i>scabra</i>, were characterized by a high percentage of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (97.8% and 76.6%, respectively), mostly represented by an equal amount of germacrene D (32.8% and 32.7%, respectively). Both leaf and flower spontaneous emissions of <i>S. dentata</i>, as well as the EO composition, showed a prevalence of monoterpenes divided into a more or less equal amount of hydrocarbon and oxygenated compounds. Interestingly, its EO had a non-negligible percentage of oxygenated sesquiterpenes (29.5%). <i>S. aurea</i> EO, on the contrary, was rich in sesquiterpenes, both hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds (41.5% and 33.5%, respectively). <i>S. dentata</i> EO showed good efficacy (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC): 0.5%) against <i>M. canis</i>. The tested EOs were not active against <i>E. coli</i> and <i>S. aureus</i>, whereas a low inhibition of <i>S. dentata</i> EO was observed on <i>S. pseudointermedius</i> (MIC = 10%). Once again, <i>S. dentata</i> EO showed a very good H1N1 inhibition; contrariwise, <i>S. aurea</i> EO was completely inactive against this virus. The low quantity of <i>S. scabra</i> EO made it impossible to test its biological activity. <i>S. dentata</i> EO exhibited interesting new perspectives for medicinal and industrial uses."

      "Sperm preservation is a crucial factor for the success of assisted reproductive technology (ART) in humans, livestock, and wildlife. Irrespective of the extender and the storage conditions used, semen handling and preservation negatively affect sperm quality. Moreover, oxidative stress, which often arises during semen storage, significantly reduces sperm function and compromises the sperm fertilizing ability by inducing oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Plant extracts have recently emerged as a cheap and natural source of additives to preserve and enhance sperm function during semen storage. The present work provides an update on the use of these natural compounds as alternative additives for sperm preservation in 13 animal species, including humans. A detailed description of the effects of 45 plant species, belonging to 28 families, on sperm function during semen storage is presented. The plant material and extraction method employed, dosage, possible toxic effects, and antimicrobial properties are provided."

      "<i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> is a zoonotic parasite of worldwide importance, responsible for toxoplasmosis in homeotherms. Although treatment options are readily available, most drugs often cause serious side effects. Extracts of <i>Dracocephalum kotschyi</i> (<i>D. kotschyi</i>) have shown significant pharmacological activity against various parasites, viruses, and bacteria. In this study, we evaluated the anti-<i>T. gondii</i> activity in vitro and in vivo of <i>D. kotschyi</i> essential oil. The thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method was used to assess the anti-<i>T. gondii</i> activity and cytotoxicity of the essential oil. The presence of <i>T. gondii</i> was observed by Giemsa staining, and the viability was evaluated by the trypan blue staining method. Furthermore, the survival rate of acutely infected mice was evaluated by intraperitoneal injecting of the essential oil (50, 100, and 200 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>) for five days after infection with 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> tachyzoites. Essential oil, negative, and positive controls that showed the best toxoplasmacidal activity were assayed in triplicate at each concentration. The essential oil exhibited the highest anti-<i>Toxoplasma</i> activity with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 9.94 ± 0.38 µg, with a selectivity index of 2.463. On Vero cells, the CC<sub>50</sub> of the oil was 24.49 ± 0.96 µg and exhibited a significant anti-<i>Toxoplasma</i> activity. Moreover, the treatment by essential oil significantly increased the survival rate compared to untreated infected control. In conclusion, the essential oil might be a useful compound, and with more testing, it may be an excellent alternative to standard chemical drugs in the treatment of toxoplasmosis."

      "Plants with medicinal properties have been used in the treatment of several infectious diseases, including <i>Acanthamoeba</i> infections. The medicinal properties of Cambodian plant extracts; <i>Annona muricata</i> and <i>Combretum trifoliatum</i> were investigated against <i>Acanthamoeba triangularis</i>. A total of 39 plant extracts were evaluated and, as a result, 22 extracts showed positive anti-<i>Acanthamoeba</i> activity. Of the 22 extracts, 9 and 4 extracts showed anti-<i>Acanthamoeba</i> activity against trophozoites and cysts of <i>A. triangularis</i>, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration of <i>A. muricata</i> and <i>C. trifoliatum</i> extracts against trophozoites and cysts was 500 and 1,000 μg/mL, respectively. The combination of <i>A. muricata</i> at 1/4×MIC with chlorhexidine at 1/8×MIC demonstrated a synergistic effect against trophozoites, but partial synergy against cysts. A 40% reduction in trophozoites and 60% of cysts adhered to the plastic surface treated with both extracts at 1/2×MIC were noted comparing to the control (P < 0.05). Furthermore, a reduction of 80% and 90% of trophozoites adhered to the surface was observed after pre-treatment with <i>A. muricata</i> and <i>C. trifoliatum</i> extracts, respectively. A 90% of cysts adhered to the surface was decreased with pre-treatment of <i>A. muricata</i> at 1/2×MIC (P < 0.05). A 75% of trophozoites and cysts from <i>Acanthamoeba</i> adhered to the surface were removed after treatment with both extracts at 4×MIC (P < 0.05). In the model of contact lens, 1 log cells/mL of trophozoites and cysts was significantly decreased post-treatment with both extracts compared to the control. Trophozoites showed strong loss of acanthopodia and thorn-like projection pseudopodia, while cysts demonstrated retraction and folded appearance treated with both extracts when observed by SEM, which suggests the potential benefits of the medicinal plants <i>A. muricata</i> and <i>C. trifoliatum</i> as an option treatment against <i>Acanthamoeba</i> infections."

      "Plants have been extensively studied since ancient times and numerous important chemical constituents with tremendous therapeutic potential are identified. Attacks of microorganisms including viruses and bacteria can be counteracted with an efficient immune system and therefore, stimulation of body's defense mechanism against infections has been proven to be an effective approach. Polysaccharides, terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, and lactones are the important phytochemicals, reported to be primarily responsible for immunomodulation activity of the plants. These phytochemicals may act as lead molecules for the development of safe and effective immunomodulators as potential remedies for the prevention and cure of viral diseases. Natural products are known to primarily modulate the immune system in nonspecific ways. A number of plant-based principles have been identified and isolated with potential immunomodulation activity which justify their use in traditional folklore medicine and can form the basis of further specified research. The aim of the current review is to describe and highlight the immunomodulation potential of certain plants along with their bioactive chemical constituents. Relevant literatures of recent years were searched from commonly employed scientific databases on the basis of their ethnopharmacological use. Most of the plants displaying considerable immunomodulation activity are summarized along with their possible mechanisms. These discussions shall hopefully elicit the attention of researchers and encourage further studies on these plant-based immunomodulation products as potential therapy for the management of infectious diseases, including viral ones such as COVID-19."

      "The widespread prevalence and mortality of coronavirus diseases-2019 (COVID-19) lead many researchers to study the SARS-CoV-s2 infection to find a treatment for this disease. Discovering the mechanisms of action of COVID-19 and coping at the cellular level with this disease can have better effects. Including the target tissues of this disease are the lungs and the immune system. It is stated that COVID-19 easily infiltrates into alveoli through its receptors and then starts to proliferate. Subsequently, with the weakening of immune cells and increase inflammatory cytokines, it increases the rate of inflammation in the body. Strengthening the immune system and inhibiting COVID-19 receptors can play a preventive or even therapeutic role for this disease. <i>Nigella sativa</i> (<i>N. sativa</i>) is one of the herbal medicines to possess numerous pharmacological effects related to several organs of the body. Among the extraordinary properties of this plant is improving asthma and several lung diseases. The recent studies have shown that <i>N. sativa</i> at the cellular level can inhibit COVID-19 receptors. It was also stated that performing regular exercise training (especially moderate-intensity exercise training) can modulate the immune system and have an anti-inflammatory effect. Since the use of herbal supplements with exercise can have tremendous therapeutic effects at the cellular level, the hypothesis to use the <i>Nigella sativa</i> along with exercise training to prophylaxis and treatment COVID-19 will be highlighted in this paper."

      "There is an increasing interest in revisiting plants for drug discovery, proving scientifically their role as remedies. The aim of this review was to give an overview of the ethnopharmacological uses of <i>Pistacia lentiscus</i> L. (PlL) leaves and fruits, expanding the search for the scientific discovery of their chemistry, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative and antimicrobial activities. PlL is a wild-growing shrub rich in terpenoids and polyphenols, the oil and extracts of which have been widely used against inflammation and infections, and as wound healing agents. The more recurrent components in PlL essential oil (EO) are represented by α-pinene, terpinene, caryophyllene, limonene and myrcene, with high variability in concentration depending on the Mediterranean country. The anti-inflammatory activity of the oil mainly occurs due to the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the arachidonic acid cascade. Interestingly, the capacity against COX-2 and LOX indicates PlL EO as a dual inhibitory compound. The high content of polyphenols enriching the extracts provide explanations for the known biological properties of the plant. The protective effect against reactive oxygen species is of wide interest. In particular, their anthocyanins content greatly clarifies their antioxidative capacity. Further, the antimicrobial activity of PlL oil and extracts includes the inhibition of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, periodontal bacteria and <i>Candida</i> spp. In conclusion, the relevant scientific properties indicate PlL as a nutraceutical and also as a therapeutic agent against a wide range of diseases based on inflammation and infections."

      "<i>Nigella</i> is a small genus of the family Ranunculaceae, which includes some popular species due to their culinary and medicinal properties, especially in Eastern Europe, Middle East, Western, and Central Asia. Therefore, this review covers the traditional uses and phytochemical composition of <i>Nigella</i> and, in particular, <i>Nigella sativa</i>. The pharmacological studies reported <i>in vitro</i>, <i>in vivo,</i> and in humans have also been reviewed. One of the main strength of the use of <i>Nigella</i> is that the seeds are rich in the omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid and provide an extra-source of dietary phytochemicals, including the bioactive thymoquinone, and characteristics saponins, alkaloids, and flavonoids. Among <i>Nigella</i> species, <i>N</i>. <i>sativa</i> L. is the most studied plant from the genus. Due to the phytochemical composition and pharmacological properties, the seed and seed oil from this plant can be considered as good candidates to formulate functional ingredients on the basis of folklore and scientific knowledge. Nonetheless, the main limations are that more studies, especially, clinical trials are required to standardize the results, e.g. to establish active molecules, dosage, chemical profile, long-term effects and impact of cooking/incorporation into foods."

      "Food poisoning is a common cause of illness and death in developing countries. Essential oils (EOs) could be effective and safe natural preservatives to prevent and control bacterial contamination of foods. However, their high sensitivity and strong flavor limit their application and biological effectiveness. The aim of this study was firstly the chemical analysis and the antimicrobial evaluation of the EOs of <i>Origanum onites</i> L. and <i>Satureja thymbra</i> L. obtained from Symi island (Greece), and, secondly, the formulation of propylene glycol-nanovesicles loaded with these EOs to improve their antimicrobial properties. The EOs were analyzed by GC-MS and their chemical contents are presented herein. Different nanovesicles were formulated with small average sizes, high homogeneity, and optimal ζ-potential. Microscopic observation confirmed their small and spherical shape. Antibacterial and antifungal activities of the formulated EOs were evaluated against food-borne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms compared to pure EOs. Propylene glycol-nanovesicles loaded with <i>O. onites</i> EO were found to be the most active formulation against all tested strains. Additionally, in vitro studies on the HaCaT cell line showed that nanovesicles encapsulated with EOs had no toxic effect. The present study revealed that both EOs can be used as alternative sanitizers and preservatives in the food industry, and that their formulation in nanovesicles can provide a suitable approach as food-grade delivery system."

      "Nowadays, herbal extracts are considered to be a potential source for developing new drugs that will overcome resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. This study was aimed to explore the efficacy of several Egyptian plant extracts against Toxoplasma gondii infection in vitro for future development of a new, safe, and effective compound for T. gondii. Methanol extracts from Matricaria chamomilla (German chamomile), Laurus nobilis, Citrullus colocynthis, Cinnamum camphora, Boswellia scara, and Melissa officionalis plants and oil extracts (either essential or fixed oils) of some plants such as: lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus), marjoram (Origanum majorana), watercress (Nasturtium officionale), wheat germ (Triticum aestivum), sesame (Sesamum indicum), rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus), citronella (Cymbopogon nardus), clove (Syzygum aromaticum), jojoba (Simmondsia chinesis), and basil (Ocimum basilicum) were investigated for their anti-Toxoplasma activities. The methanol extracts from C. colocynthis and L. nobilis and the oil extracts from lemon grass and marjoram were active against T. gondii with half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 22.86 µg/ml, 31.35 µg/ml, 4.6 µg/ml, and 26.24 µg/ml, respectively. Their selectivity index (SI) values were <10. Interestingly, the methanol extract from M. chamomilla and oil from citronella had the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> values for T. gondii (3.56 µg/ml and 2.54 µg/ml, respectively) and the highest SI values (130.33 and 15.02, respectively). In conclusion, methanol extract from M. chamomilla and oil from citronella might be potential sources of novel therapies for treating toxoplasmosis."

      "Greek oregano and common oregano were compared in respect of the antioxidant and antibacterial activity of the corresponding essential oils and hydroethanolic extracts in relation with their chemical profile. The chemical composition of essential oils was determined by GC-MS and GC-FID, while extracts (phenolic acids and flavonoids fractions) were analyzed by HPLC-DAD. Based on given volatiles, the investigated subspecies represented two chemotypes: a carvacrol/γ-terpinene/<i>p</i>-cymene type in the case of Greek oregano and a sabinyl/cymyl type rich in terpinen-4-ol in common oregano. Within non-volatile phenolic compounds, rosmarinic acid appeared to dominate in both subspecies. Lithospermic acid B, chlorogenic acid and isovitexin were present only in Greek oregano extracts. However, the total content of flavonoids was higher in common oregano extracts. The essential oil and extract of Greek oregano revealed visibly stronger antibacterial activity (expressed as MIC and MBC) than common oregano, whereas the antioxidant potential (determined by DPPH, ABTS and FRAP) of these extracts was almost equal for both subspecies. In the case of <i>Origanum</i> plants, the potential application of essential oils and extracts as antiseptic and antioxidant agents in the food industry should be preceded by subspecies identification followed by recognition of their chemotype concerning both terpene and phenolics composition."
