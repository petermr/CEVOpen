<p>The results of proximate analysis of
 <italic> L. kerstingii</italic> seeds are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. The moisture content of seeds was 3.61%, which is low and therefore beneficial for prolonging the shelf life of the seeds. The seeds contained significant amounts of crude oil (57.85 g/100 g), crude protein (26.39 g/100 g), and ash (2.08 g/100 g). The ash and crude protein were in the range of those reported for
 <italic> Arachis hypogaea</italic> L. and
 <italic> Pentaclethra macrophylla</italic> Benth. [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The crude oil content was higher than those of some commercial seed oils, namely, soybean, cotton seeds, and rubber seeds [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].
 <italic> L. kerstingii</italic> seeds also contained significant amounts of minerals. The most abundant was potassium followed by magnesium, calcium, zinc, iron, and sodium. These results showed that
 <italic> L. kerstingii</italic> seeds can be regarded as a good source of oil, protein and minerals.
