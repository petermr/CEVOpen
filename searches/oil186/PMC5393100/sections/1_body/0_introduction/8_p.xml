<p>Taking into account the above-mentioned information regarding the biological activities of anise fruits in ancient and modern medicine, the current study has been performed to assess possible effect of 
 <italic>P. anisum</italic> fruit extract as well as essential oil in animal model of NAFLD. For this purpose, biochemical parameters related to NAFLD along with histopathological investigation of liver tissue have been considered as primary outcomes. As oxidative stress has a major role in pathophysiology of NAFLD, the biomarkers associated with oxidative stress have been also determined as secondary outcomes.
