<p class="p">The regression equation, the correlation coefficient, LOD, and LOQ of each main component used as standards were established and are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The standard curves of each main component were prepared by plotting the response area versus concentration. The acceptance criterion for linearity is given by the correlation coefficient, which must be greater than or equal to 0.99 [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. A good linearity response was obtained with the method developed for the two main components of each essential oil used as standards. These values make it possible to ensure that the methods are capable of quantifying the main compounds in the established range.
