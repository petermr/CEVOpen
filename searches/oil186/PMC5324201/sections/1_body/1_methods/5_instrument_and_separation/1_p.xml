<p class="p">Fatty acid methyl esters were analysed and identified by using Shimadzu 2025 Gas Chromatograph with a Flame Ionization Detector and GC Work Station Software. A fused capillary column AT™-1 (30 m × 0.25 mm I.d. and 0.1 μm film thickness) was used for separation. Helium was used as carrier gas, at a flow rate of 2 mL/min. Injection and detector temperature was 250 °C. The oven temperature was programmed at 120 °C −270 °C by raising the temperature at 7 °C/min. Split ratio was 80. The fatty acid compounds were identified by comparison of relative retention times and peak positions of the standard fatty acid chromatogram. Atherogenic Index (AI) and Thrombogenic Index (TI) were calculated according to Ulbricht and Southgate [
