<p>The antimicrobial activity of EOs depends on their chemical constituents. Apparently, the antimicrobial activity of the EO analyzed is related to the presence of phenolic compounds (thymol) and terpene hydrocarbons (γ-terpinene), respectively [

  <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
 </bold>], which might represent another cause of the antimicrobial activity recorded. On the other hand, a number of studies have shown that EOS exhibit stronger antimicrobial activity than that of their major constituents or their mixtures, respectively [

  <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
 </bold>,

  <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
