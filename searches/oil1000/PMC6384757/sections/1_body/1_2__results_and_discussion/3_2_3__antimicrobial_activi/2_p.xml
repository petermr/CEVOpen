<p class="p">Interestingly, SDE oil showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity with a 13 mm diameter on average. Furthermore, MICs of different 
 <italic class="italic">A. argyi</italic> essential oils against eight microbes were also tested (listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00483-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> and shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00483-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). MICs of SDE oil against most microorganisms were 6.25 μL/mL, peaking at 12.5 μL/mL. In contrast, MICs of hydrodistilled and subcritical extracts were mostly higher than 12.5 μL/mL and several values even reached 25 μL/mL. As the results above indicate, SDE oil showed a higher antimicrobial activity than the other two oils, which suggested that SDE oil could be a good candidate for an antimicrobial agent. Danh et al. reported that the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic class="italic">A. argyi</italic> essential oil was predominantly controlled by the amount of active compound with high diffusivity in agar medium [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-00483" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. During hydrodistillation and subcritical extraction, compounds could be hardly diffused, and those with high hydrophobicities exerted little influence on the antimicrobial activities of resultant oils [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-00483" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The antimicrobial activities of essential oils were apparently related to the large amount of caryophyllene oxide, neointermedeol, borneol, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-thujone and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene. The activity of SDE oil was superior to those of subcritical and hydrodistilled extracts, which displayed lower MICs and larger inhibition zones. Compared with SDE, hydrodistillation needs large quantity of water and higher temperature, which would cause hydrolysis reaction and damage the active compound. Subcritical extraction would bring some miscellaneous ingredients such as wax and pigment. These ingredients might be the reason for the less inhibitory effect of essential oil extracted by subcritical extraction [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-00483" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. On the other hand, the highest antimicrobial activity of essential oil extracted by SDE might also be related with 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-hexane which has the appropriate polarity to accumulate active antimicrobial ingredients.
