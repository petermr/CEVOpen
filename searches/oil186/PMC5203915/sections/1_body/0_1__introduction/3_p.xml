<p class="p">As no description currently exists of the chemical composition of
 <italic class="italic"> Rhaponticum carthamoides</italic> essential oil from hairy roots (HR), the aim of the present study was to determine this. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity of this essential oil in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) stimulated astrocytes and its antimicrobial potential were also examined. As the comparative material for phytochemical and biological studies essential oil from the roots of soil-grown plants (SGR) was used.
