 <xref rid="B48-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] reported that the total phenolic component of a crude methanolic extract of 
 <italic class="italic">Mentha spicata</italic> was found to be 27.26 ± 0.62 mg/g gallic acid equivalent. The DPPH radical scavenging activity was found to increase with increasing concentrations and was found to be 54.84% ± 0.57% with an IC

 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>] studied the chemical composition and antioxidant activities of spearmint essential oil harvested from Portugal and reported the identification of 30 components that constitute 87.7% of the total composition. Oxygenated monoterpenes (46.3%), monoterpene hydrocarbons (25.5%), and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (14.1%) were found to be the major constituent groups, with the monoterpere carvone (41.1%) as the main constituent. This essential oil showed antioxidant activity both by DPPH radical scavenging method (31.45%) and by system β-carotene/acid linoleic method (14.89%).
