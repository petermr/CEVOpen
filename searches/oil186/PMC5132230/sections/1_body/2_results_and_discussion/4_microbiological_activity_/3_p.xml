<p>Studies by Simionatto et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0166684.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] with isolated compounds from 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>suaveolens</italic> analyzed by bioautography showed that the lactone monoterpene massoialactona exhibited excellent antibacterial property to 
 <italic>Salmonella Setubal</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> microorganisms, being active in the minimum concentration that was tested (3.125 μg.mL
 <sup>-1</sup>). In this study, however, the 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>suaveolens</italic> EO showed better bacteriostatic activity (50 mg.mL
 <sup>-1</sup>) for 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella sp</italic>. and bactericidal activity (100 mg.mL
 <sup>-1</sup>) only for 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>coli</italic>. This may be due to the low yield of massoialactona (2.496%) compared with other compounds identified in this study.
