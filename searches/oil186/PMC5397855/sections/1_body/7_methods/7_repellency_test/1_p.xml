<p class="p">Four Petri dishes (12 × 1.5 cm) were used as an arena, connected to a central board with plastic tubes (diameter 2 cm) at an angle of 45°. The other dishes were distributed around them in equidistant distances and two plates were put together symmetrically opposed. Two hundred and forty individuals (120 larvae and 120 adults) of 
 <italic class="italic">T. molitor</italic> were released in the central board and the control group received sugarcane and chayote. A total of 5 uL of the estimated LC
 <sub class="sub">90</sub> lethal concentration of garlic essential oil and toxic compounds were applied on absorbent filter paper (2 × 2 cm) placed in two opposite plates used as treatment and two opposite ones with 5 uL of distilled water for absorbent filter paper represented the control. Four replicates per treatment and control were evaluated by the number of individuals per plate after 24 hours calculating the repellency index (IR): RI = 
 <italic class="italic">2</italic> 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>/(
 <italic class="italic">L</italic> + 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>), where G is the percentage of insects in the treatment and P is the percentage of insects in control. Treatments were classified as neutral if the index was equal to one (1); repellent, higher than one (1), and; attractive lower than one (1).
