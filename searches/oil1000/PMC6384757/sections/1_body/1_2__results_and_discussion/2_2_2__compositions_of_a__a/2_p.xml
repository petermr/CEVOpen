<p class="p">The contents of compounds varied markedly along with the extraction method. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00483-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, a total of 65, 62 and nine compounds were identified for the essential oil extracted with hydrodistillation, subcritical extraction and SDE, accounting for the 86.318%, 94.496% and 99.997% of total oil, respectively. Different from SDE oil, subcritical extraction oil and hydrodistillation oil were dominated by the monoterpene fractions with 62.479% and 48.021%, respectively. However, the total content of monoterpene fractions in SDE oil was 45.49% and no monoterpene hydrocarbon fractions were determined. On the other hand, SDE oil was dominated by the sesquiterpene fractions, and large amount of the oxygenated sesquiterpene (40.82%) was found. Although different extraction methods produced essential oils with various chemical compositions, there were five major compounds in common, including caryophyllene oxide, neointermedeol, borneol, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-thujone and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00483-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, the total of these five compounds accounted for around 82.93%, 40.90% and 40.33% for SDE, subcritical extraction and hydrodistillation, respectively. Similarly, it is well-documented that caryophyllene oxide, neointermedeol, borneol, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>-thujone and 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic>-caryophyllene had the highest contents [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-00483" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Mevy et al. have proved that these components exhibited antioxidant, antibacterial and other biological activities [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-00483" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Additionally, compared with the other two methods, the contents of these common ingredients in SDE essential oil was obviously higher. Usually, traditional essential oil extractions are time consuming and high temperature needed. These methods might lose some volatiles and significantly degrade unsaturated compounds or esters [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-00483" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Similarly, SDE would also result in severe losses of volatile materials, because oil-containing hexane should be subsequently removed by rotary evaporation.
