Abstract</div> <p>Medicinal plants are a pertinent and effective remedy, employed in indigenous healthcare systems by traditional healers. This study focused on proximate parameters, minerals, vitamins, anti-nutrients and essential oil of the root and leaf of the medicinal plant; <i>R. crispus</i>, using the standard food analysis techniques. The result reveals that the moisture content of the leaf (7.57 ± 0.40%) and root (7.59 ± 0.08%) was not significantly different. The leaf has a higher ash, crude fat, fibre and mineral content than the root, except the carbohydrate (57.74 ± 3.06%) and Ca (1190.0 ± 0 mg/100g) values which are quite higher in the root. Traces of phytate was found in the leaf (1.15 ± 0.74%) and root (1.38 ± 0.27%) of <i>R. crispus</i>. The highest value of retinol, ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol was found in dried leaf (1.29 ± 0.014 mg retinol/100g), fresh leaf (159.73 ± 26.77 mg ascorbic acid/100g) and fresh root (54.90 ± 0.39 mg α-tocopherol/100g) respectively. The principal compound in the essential oil of the leaf are; 5-Eicosene, (E)-, docos-1-ene, trans-5-Octadecene, tetradecane while those found in the root are; 1-Heptacosanol, 4-Methyloctane, ethylcyclohexane, eucalyptol, m-Xylene, octadecane, phytol, and tetradecane. The research reveals that <i>R. crispus</i> may not only be used for medicinal purposes but could also be suitable for a complementary diet. </p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="kwd" title="kwd">

1. Introduction</div> <p>The use of medicinal plants for therapy and other uses has always been part of human culture. The first records of the use of herbal medicine being acknowledged dated back 5000 years in China. On the other hand, India’s Ayurvedic traditional herbal medicine is believed to have been practiced for more than 5000 years [ <a href="#B1-plants-08-00051">1</a>]. For centuries, people have been so close to nature (the environment) and they rely on its fauna and flora as a source of medicine and food [ <a href="#B2-plants-08-00051">2</a>]. The uses of a particular species of plant for a specific ailment are similar across a geographical region and today, a large population of certain countries still depends on herbal remedies for their healthcare needs. In South Africa, the use of herbal medicine as an alternative therapy is on the increase and propagated by the traditional healers and elders in the communities. The extraction of crude plant extracts by the traditional healers either by decoction, tincture, infusion or other means are common practice all over the world. However, the effectiveness and mechanisms of action of the plant extracts are still under scrutinization scientifically. Several studies, in the fields of ethnopharmacology and medical ethnobotany, stressed the significance of phytotherapy to people in the different regions of the world, irrespective of the current civilization [ <a href="#B3-plants-08-00051">3</a>]. </p> <p>Morris (2011) [ <a href="#B4-plants-08-00051">4</a>], attests that the use of medicinal plants is the most widespread cultural heritage and the most ancient form of treatment. It was estimated at the end of the 20th century that more than two billion people globally (34% of the world’s population) will rely on medicinal plants as their principal treatment for illness [ <a href="#B3-plants-08-00051">3</a>]. At the moment, there is a lack of exact appraisals concerning uses of medicinal plants as resources for the treatment of ailment across the globe. Therefore, quantitative estimations of herbal plants used by folklore medicine could be useful tools to extrapolate the consumption of medicinal plant resources, but there are no records [ <a href="#B5-plants-08-00051">5</a>, <a href="#B6-plants-08-00051">6</a>, <a href="#B7-plants-08-00051">7</a>]. </p> <p>Several floras, used traditionally for medicinal purposes, have been the target of researchers in the pursuit for therapeutically effective drugs. The medicinal properties of plants are the function of the non-nutrient and the nutrient constituents. Among the medicinal plant ethnobotanically reported in South Africa, <i>Rumex crispus</i> L. is well known and it has been used for ages in traditional medicine, for its various biological activities and therapeutic efficacy [ <a href="#B8-plants-08-00051">8</a>, <a href="#B9-plants-08-00051">9</a>]. The aerial and underground part of the plant is commonly used in different parts of the world for the treatment of various diseases. The young leaves of the plant are eaten as salads, soups, or cooked as a potherb. It is less bitter compared to the mature leaves that have more oxalic acid. The plant has been reported to be used for the treatment of anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, dermatology infections, gastrointestinal tract diseases (e.g., ascariasis), upper respiratory tract diseases (such as a sore throat and nasal sinuses), laxative, treat piles, and dysentery [ <a href="#B8-plants-08-00051">8</a>, <a href="#B9-plants-08-00051">9</a>, <a href="#B10-plants-08-00051">10</a>]. The bioactive substances of <i>R. crispus</i> are a reflection of the medicinal importance due to its phytochemical composition such as; flavonoids (isorientin, vitexin, orientin and isovitexin), lipids, vitamins, carotenoids, organic acids and minerals. The root of <i>R. crispus</i> is rich in anthraquinones glycosides (chrysophanol and emodin) [ <a href="#B11-plants-08-00051">11</a>]. Generally, the genus of Rumex is characterized to be a rich source of anthraquinones [ <a href="#B12-plants-08-00051">12</a>], polysaccharides, carotenoids, triterpenoids, tannins, stilbenoids, flavonoids, naphthalenes, and naphthalenes [ <a href="#B13-plants-08-00051">13</a>]. In a non-shell, the juice from <i>R. crispus</i> is either consumed fresh or cooked and it contains some nutritional and anti-nutritional components. </p> <p> <i>R. crispus</i> also possess essential oil. Essential oil is a concentrated hydrophobic aromatic liquid, containing volatile aroma compounds from plant’s secondary metabolite. They are used for aesthetic, medicinal purposes and food seasonings. The important roles of essential oils to plants are for protection against viral, insect, fungal, bacterial and herbivore attack [ <a href="#B14-plants-08-00051">14</a>]. Essential oils are also referred to as volatile oil; they may oxidize on exposure to the atmosphere, which may result in a change in colouration. Hence, there is need to store extracted essential oil in a cool, dry place, inside an airtight amber glass container. Essential oils are complex natural compounds with a strong aroma, usually produced by odoriferous plants. Quite a number of essential oils have been extracted from various plants such as; clove, eucalyptus, lemon, peppermint, cedarwood, frankincense, rosemary, lavender, <i>R. crispus</i> and many more. The volatile oil possesses by aromatic plants, bears some bioactive compounds with different pharmacological activities. The study of the constituents of essential oils is still understudied but the knowledge of volatile oils constituents is of enormous significance in the area of development of novel drugs [ <a href="#B15-plants-08-00051">15</a>, <a href="#B16-plants-08-00051">16</a>]. </p> <p>The soil type, texture and exposure of a plant to environmental hazard could influence the nutritional compositions, and growth is proportional to the available nutrients in the soil [ <a href="#B17-plants-08-00051">17</a>]. Sorrenti et al. (2016) [ <a href="#B18-plants-08-00051">18</a>] confirmed and supported by Paetsch et al. (2017) [ <a href="#B19-plants-08-00051">19</a>] that environmental conditions can lead to modifications of the physicochemical properties of soil, and influences plants nutritional and phytochemical composition [ <a href="#B20-plants-08-00051">20</a>]. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to identify and compare the total proximate, vitamins and essential oil composition, of the root and leaf of <i>R. crispus</i>. </p> </div> <div class="2.materialsandmethods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

2.1. Plant Materials Preparation</div> <p>The leaf and the root of wild <i>Rumex crispus</i> were collected (32°47′1.23′′ S, 26°51′9.85′′ E) in late summer of 2017, identified, and the sample was deposited in Giffen’s herbarium (Idr-Med-2017/03), Department of Botany, University of Fort Hare. The essential oil was extracted from the fresh plant sample with Solvent Free Microwave Extraction (SFME) and Hydrodistillation (HD). Subsequently, the remaining of the collected plant material was dried in a controlled environment at room temperature. The dried plant sample was pulverized with an electric blender (Polymix PX-MFC90D Switzerland) and stored in an airtight dark bottle in the refrigerator at 4 ± 2 °C until use. </p> </div> <div class="2.2.reagentsused" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

3.1. Proximate Composition</div> <p>The proximate composition of the dried pulverized root and leaf of <i>R. crispus</i> was evaluated and presented in <a href="#plants-08-00051-f001">Figure 1</a>. The moisture content of the leaf and root (7.57 ± 0.40% and 7.59 ± 0.08% respectively) was not significantly different. The ash content of the leaf (15.35 ± 0.04%) was found to be higher than the root (6.22 ± 0.28%), which indicates a higher mineral concentration in the leaf. The level of fat in the leaf (2.01 ± 0.24%) was twice that of the root (0.90 ± 0.14%) and the crude protein of the leaf (26.37 ± 0.06%) was found to be significantly higher than the protein of the root (3.75 ± 0.31%). The fibre (NDF) level of the leaf (46.02 ± 3.13%) was higher than the root while the carbohydrate (NFC) of the root (57.74 ± 3.06%) was higher than the leaf, maybe due to lesser fibre levels ( <a href="#plants-08-00051-f001">Figure 1</a>). The estimated oxidizable energy of the root (1063.23 ± 95.31 KJ/100g) is significantly higher than that of the leaf (688.72 ± 81.5 KJ/100g), which could be due to the higher carbohydrate content of the root. </p> </div> <div class="3.2.mineralcomposition" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

4. Discussion</div> <p>Medicinal plants are of great economic importance, especially in the area of health improvement [ <a href="#B2-plants-08-00051">2</a>] and they play a significant role in drug development. Using a metabolite profiling, studies show that some plants have phytochemicals that are highly medicinal [ <a href="#B44-plants-08-00051">44</a>] and could be influenced by the nutritional and the essential oil composition of the plant. The traditional usage of <i>R. crispus</i> suggests, it is a plant of high medicinal value and it has been proven to have anthelmintic, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial potentials due to its bioactive component, especially polyphenols and alkaloids [ <a href="#B9-plants-08-00051">9</a>]. In this study, our results highlight the key proximate chemical composition of <i>R. crispus</i> and its relationship to traditional medicine and health benefits. </p> <p>The shelf life of medicinal plants depends on moisture, temperature and other environmental factors. It was argued that plant material with a level of moisture higher than 8% favours the invasion of insects and moisture content of plant materials higher than 15% stands the risk of having been contaminated with bacteria and fungi [ <a href="#B45-plants-08-00051">45</a>]. The outcome of this research reveals that the moisture content of the dried samples of the leaf (7.57 ± 0.40%) and root (7.59 ± 0.08%) of <i>R. crispus</i> have low moisture and could be preserved with little risk of insect and microorganism invasion, hence increasing its shelf life. The result of the moisture content was close to the moisture content of <i>Rumex dentatus</i> Linn. and <i>Rumex nepalensis</i> Spreng. as reported by Hameed and Dastagir (2009) [ <a href="#B46-plants-08-00051">46</a>]. The level of the ash contents of the plant suggested the availability of inorganic constituents which is subsequently confirmed by the considerably high content of mineral compositions. Referring to the percentage of ash, our values in the leaf (15.35 ± 0.04%) slightly doubled the values of the root (6.22 ± 0.28%) of <i>R. crispus</i> which is in accordance with those described by Hameed and Dastagir (2009) [ <a href="#B46-plants-08-00051">46</a>]. The ash content closely suggested the reason why the mineral level of the leaf is higher than the root, except for the calcium composition in the root (1190.0 ± 0 mg/100g) which is significantly higher. The leaf is no doubt a better source of minerals than the root. In general, minerals have been confirmed to be essential in human nutrition for overall physical and mental wellbeing. </p> <p>The fat and oil in the plant was extracted and quantified as shown in <a href="#plants-08-00051-f001">Figure 1</a>. The leaf (2.01 ± 0.24%) has more fat and it was twice the value of fat recorded in the root (0.90 ± 0.14%). Fat is one of the major component causing differences in the gross energy of various food substance, it yields over 9 Kcal/g compared to carbohydrates and proteins that yield about 5 Kcal/g. Nagao and Yanagita, (2010) [ <a href="#B47-plants-08-00051">47</a>], reported medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) and medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) have a therapeutic advantage in preserving insulin sensitivity as found in animal models and patients with type 2 diabetes. The level of oil in <i>R. crispus</i> could contribute to its medicinal potency. Digestible carbohydrates are another source of energy in the diet. The higher NDF level of the leaf (46.02 ± 3.13%) could have been due to lesser NFC (10.25 ± 2.37%) but these were contrary in the root which has higher digestible carbohydrate (57.74 ± 3.06%) and lesser fibre (31.38 ± 3.79%). The estimated oxidizable energy of the root was found to be 1063.23 ± 95.31 KJ/100g which is signifcantly higher than that of the leaf (688.72 ± 81.5 KJ/100g) and the reason is not far-fetched from the higher level of digestible carbohydrate contained in the root as shown in <a href="#plants-08-00051-f001">Figure 1</a>. Elhayany et al. (2010) [ <a href="#B48-plants-08-00051">48</a>], concluded in their research that a low carbohydrate diet could reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and control diabetes among obese patients. <i>R. crispus</i> could be advantageous in this regard as the leaf is predominantly being consumed as a vegetable. </p> <p>In this research, the organic nitrogen content was used to express the crude proteins (Nitrogen × 6.25), the highest values were found in the leaf (26.37 ± 0.06%) as compared to the protein content of the root (3.75 ± 0.31%) of <i>R. crispus</i>. According to the guidelines for dietary protein intake, 0.8 g per kilogram of body weight (g/kg BW/d) daily was recommended for human regardless of age or sex [ <a href="#B49-plants-08-00051">49</a>, <a href="#B50-plants-08-00051">50</a>, <a href="#B51-plants-08-00051">51</a>], however, this recommendation does not consider changes in hormone levels, immunity, metabolism and ill-health. The leaf of the <i>R. crispus</i> could, therefore, be recommended as a good source of protein in the complementary diet. </p> <p>Phytate is the free-acid form of myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) and it is the primary storage form of phosphorus in many plant tissues, predominantly seeds and bran. Although, there have been few reports of phytate being found in other tissue of the plant aside from the storage tissues or reproductive organs [ <a href="#B52-plants-08-00051">52</a>]. The values of the phytate in the leaf and root of <i>R. crispus</i> were found to be 1.15 ± 0.74% and 1.38 ± 0.27% respectively, which was considered to be trace according to Alkarawi and Zotz, (2014) [ <a href="#B52-plants-08-00051">52</a>]. On the other hand, phytate has been confirmed to have effects on absorption and digestion of some minerals and impacts negatively on some protein and lipid utilisation in the body. This is possible due to its affinity to chelate with cations such as magnesium, calcium, iron, zinc, potassium and copper to form insoluble salts [ <a href="#B53-plants-08-00051">53</a>]. Oxalate is an anti-nutrient that occurs in many plants as calcium oxalate deposit, in the tissue. The leaf and root of <i>R. crispus</i> were evaluated to have a deposit of calcium oxalate (0.15 ± 0.019 mg/g and 0.11 ± 0.0033 mg/g) respectively. The biological roles of oxalate in the plant include calcium regulation, tolerance to heavy metals, protection against herbivores and helps in plant growth, but in human, it could form a larger kidney stone that can block the kidney tubule [ <a href="#B54-plants-08-00051">54</a>]. Although oxalic acid has low toxicity with a minimal lethal dose of 5 g for an adult [ <a href="#B55-plants-08-00051">55</a>], a recommended dose not higher than 2.5 g in foods was suggested to avoid toxic effect [ <a href="#B56-plants-08-00051">56</a>]. </p> <p>The fat-soluble vitamin A content of the plant was evaluated using retinol equivalent. The dried sample of the leaf (1.29 ± 0.014 mg retinol/100g) has the highest retinol and the dried root (0.74 ± 0.034 mg retinol/100g) has the lowest value of vitamin A which is commensurable to the recommended Average Requirement (AR) of vitamin A, by European Union (EU) for average body weight adult men (68.1 kg) and women (58.5 kg) with an established ARs values of 0.57 mg retinol equivalent (RE)/day and 0.49 mg RE/day respectively [ <a href="#B57-plants-08-00051">57</a>]. Vitamin C is another essential micronutrient that was quantified in this research using ascorbic acid (AA) equivalent. It is a strong aqueous-phase antioxidant that scavenges free radicals and reduces oxidative stress [ <a href="#B58-plants-08-00051">58</a>]. The fresh sample of the leaf (159.73 ± 26.77 mg AA/100g) and root (43.07 ± 3.49 mg AA/100g) has higher ascorbic acid content compared to the dried samples. Vitamin C is less stable to heat, hence this might result in the lesser value of the ascorbic acid content of the pulverized samples as shown in <a href="#plants-08-00051-t002">Table 2</a>. According to Frei and Trabe (2001), the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin C for adults (≥19 years) is 75 mg/day for a female and 90 mg/day for a male. <i>R. crispus</i> could be a complementary diet for the deficiency of vitamin C. Unlike ascorbic acid, vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin with the most potent lipid-soluble antioxidant in the plasma. The daily RDA for vitamin E is 8 and 10 mg/day α-tocopherol equivalents for adult women and men respectively [ <a href="#B59-plants-08-00051">59</a>]. In contrast to the value of vitamin C, the vitamin E content of the dried and fresh samples do not show heat or moisture dependence. The fresh sample of the root (54.90 ± 0.39 mg α-tocopherol/100g) has the highest value, followed by the dried leaf (54.71 ± 0.38 mg α-tocopherol/100g). The least value of tocopherol was found in the fresh leaf (53.87 ± 0.21). This could be due to the thermal stability of vitamin E at high temperature as reported by Työppönen and Hakkarainen (1985) [ <a href="#B60-plants-08-00051">60</a>], that maximum destruction of vitamin E will occur at 120 °C for 24 h. </p> <p>The essential oils obtained using SFME and HDE were quantitatively and qualitatively similar, but some compounds found in HDE are not found in SFME and vice versa in the essential oil of the fresh root and leaf of <i>R. crispus.</i> For comparison of chemical components of the extracted essential oil, same weight (400 g each) of fresh samples were used throughout the extraction process, the microwave extraction was done in 30 min without adding any solvent, and Hydro-distillation extraction was performed for 180 min using distilled water. The principal volatile compound found in the leaf are 5-Eicosene; possessing antimicrobial activities [ <a href="#B32-plants-08-00051">32</a>], docos-1-ene, trans-5-Octadecene, and tetradecane which was reported by Kavitha and Uduman (2017) [ <a href="#B42-plants-08-00051">42</a>] as an antimicrobial compound. While in the root; 1-Heptacosanol was one of the principal components which was reported to be nematicidal, anticancer, antioxidant and antimicrobial [ <a href="#B29-plants-08-00051">29</a>], 4-Methyloctane; could be used as tumor biomarker [ <a href="#B31-plants-08-00051">31</a>], ethylcyclohexane, tetradecane, eucalyptol; it has antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory properties [ <a href="#B35-plants-08-00051">35</a>], m-Xylene; It can enhance antibacterial and antifungal activities [ <a href="#B38-plants-08-00051">38</a>], octadecane; was reported by Girija et al., (2014) [ <a href="#B40-plants-08-00051">40</a>], to be active against bacterial, phytol; was also reported as an antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diureti compound [ <a href="#B41-plants-08-00051">41</a>]. However, their proportions depend on the type of isolation technique used, HDE was found to have more yield ( <a href="#plants-08-00051-t003">Table 3</a>). In conclusion, the principal volatile compound such as tetradecane, 1-Heptacosanol, octadecane, tetradecane, were also part of the composition of the analysis of essential oil collected from <i>R. crispus</i> as reported by Miyazawa and Kameoka, (1983) [ <a href="#B61-plants-08-00051">61</a>]. </p> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="conclusions"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
5. Conclusions</div> <p>The chemical composition determines the physiological properties and medicinal value of a plant. The medicinal potential of <i>R. crispus</i> could have been due to the chemical composition and nutritional value as studied in this research. The result of the proximate indicates that the plant is mainly constituted by carbohydrates and then followed by protein, ash, moisture and fat. The high level of ash revealed the presence of high mineral composition in the plant. In the results, vitamins and anti-nutrients show significant differences ( <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05); it was observed between the samples studied as recorded in <a href="#plants-08-00051-t002">Table 2</a>. The essential oil component of <i>R. crispus</i> also revealed differences in the parts of the plant used. In conclusion, with the rapid increase in the demand for natural products, natural medicine and complimentary diet foods, <i>R. crispus</i> is a potential source that could be explored. </p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
