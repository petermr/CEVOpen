<p class="p">The antimicrobial activity test was done according to the protocol described by Snoussi

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-20-14402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] for 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> spp. strains. For the experiments, a loopful of the microorganisms working stocks were enriched on a tube containing 9 mL of Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with 1% NaCl then incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h. The overnight cultures were used for the antimicrobial activity of the essential oils used in this study and the optical density was adjusted at 0.5 (OD
 <sub class="sub">520nm</sub>). The inocula were streaked onto Mueller Hinton 1% NaCl agar plates; then the sterile filter discs (diameter 6 mm, Biolife, Milano, Italy) were impregnated with 10.4 µL of essential oil (10.4 µL of essential oil weighed 10 mg).
