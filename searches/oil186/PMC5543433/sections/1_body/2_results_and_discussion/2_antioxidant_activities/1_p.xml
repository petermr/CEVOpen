<p id="Par43">Plants with radical scavenging property and antioxidant capacity are useful for medicinal applications and as food additive. So, in the present study, the antioxidant capacity of 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO was evaluated using DPPH radical scavenging method by comparing with the activity of the Ascorbic acid as a known antioxidant. The DPPH test aims at measuring the capacity of the essential oil to scavenge the stable free radical DPPH
 <sup>.</sup> by donation of hydrogen atom or an electron [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. If the extracts have the capacity to scavenge the DPPH free radical, the initial blue/purple solution will change to a yellow colour due to the formation of diphenylpicrylhydrazine. The effect of the different 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO on DPPH radical scavenging was compared to those of ascorbic acid, used as positive control, and appreciated by the determination of the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, DPPH test revealed that the free radical-scavenging activity was a dose dependent manner. From the analysis of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, we can conclude that the radical-scavenging activity of the 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO and positive controls ascorbic acid increased with increasing concentration (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05). The current study demonstrated that 
 <italic>Cl</italic>EO exhibited a strong radical scavenging activity as compared to the standard ascorbic acid.
