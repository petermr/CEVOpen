Abstract</div> <p>The indiscriminate use of antibiotics has led to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria which has become one of the biggest challenges of the twenty-first century for the researchers to combat and in turn search for novel targets which could lead to the development of effective and sustainable therapies. Inhibition of biofilm formation and virulence of bacterial pathogens is an emerging approach to address the challenges related to bacterial infections. To suppress the virulence and biofilm formation by <i>Escherichia coli</i> O157:H7 (ECOH), we developed stable nanoemulsion (NE) of <i>Gaultheria fragrantissima</i> Wall. essential oil’s (EO) bioactive compounds, viz., eugenol (E-NE) and methyl salicylate (MS-NE) that showed significantly higher anti-biofilm and anti-virulence activities as compared to eugenol and methyl salicylate without affecting ECOH planktonic cell growth. Transcriptional analysis showed that E-NE and MS-NE reduced the expression of genes, including curli, type I fimbriae, Shiga-like toxins, quorum sensing, and <i>ler</i>-controlled toxins, which are needed for biofilm formation, pathogenicity, and attachment. E-NE and MS-NE loaded hydrogel coatings showed superior anti-biofilm activity against ECOH on glass, plastic and meat surfaces as compared to eugenol and methyl salicylate loaded coatings. Conclusively, NE-loaded hydrogel coatings could be used in combating ECOH infection on solid surfaces through anti-biofilm and anti-virulence strategies. </p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p> <i>Escherichia coli</i> O157:H7 (ECOH) is one of the Shiga toxin–producing serotype that causes hemorrhagic colitis, bloody diarrhea, kidney failure, and abdominal cramps <sup> <a href="#CR1">1</a> </sup>. ECOH is commonly found in the large intestine of mammals, and could be ingested through undercooked meat, colonized surfaces, and contaminated water <sup> <a href="#CR1">1</a>, <a href="#CR2">2</a> </sup>. More specifically, Shiga-like toxin is associated with hemolytic-uremic syndrome <sup> <a href="#CR3">3</a> </sup>. ECOH can survive in adverse conditions including low-moisture environments and also has the capability to develop resistance to antibiotic <sup> <a href="#CR4">4</a> </sup>. There is no effective therapy available due to the failure of existing antimicrobial agents and the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Also increased dosage causes the hemolytic-uremic syndrome, a common factor of acute kidney injury in children <sup> <a href="#CR3">3</a> </sup>. </p> <p>Bacterial biofilms are amorphous and dynamic mono- or poly-microbial structures adhering to living or non-living surfaces <sup> <a href="#CR5">5</a> </sup>. This adaptation is a common survival strategy used by bacteria to shield from antimicrobial agents and also provides resistance from host immune clearance. To develop biofilm, bacterial pathogens produce an extracellular polymeric substance composed of proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides, and water as the main components <sup> <a href="#CR5">5</a>, <a href="#CR6">6</a> </sup>. The biofilm formation enhances the pathogenicity of bacteria and plays a key role in causing nosocomial infections <sup> <a href="#CR5">5</a> </sup>. </p> <p>The ability of ECOH to develop biofilm is the most important virulence characteristic that increases its survival in harsh conditions. Biofilms are multiple component structures of bacteria and some fungi, particularly <i>Candida albicans</i> in which cells stick to each other on living or non-living surfaces <sup> <a href="#CR7">7</a>– <a href="#CR12">12</a> </sup>. Biofilms protect bacteria from the treatment of antibiotics and external aggregation such as predator attacks. ECOH has also the ability to form antibiotic-resistant biofilms on solid surfaces, including, plastic, glass, and meat <sup> <a href="#CR13">13</a> </sup>. Biofilm formation in ECOH has implications in mortality, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) secretion, and fimbriae production <sup> <a href="#CR14">14</a>, <a href="#CR15">15</a> </sup>. Because ECOH is a clinically important pathogen, search for potent biofilm inhibitors from phytosources without affecting the bacterial cell viability is urgently required which can also minimize the risk of drug resistance. </p> <p>Essential oils (EOs) are plant-derived volatile secondary metabolites. Due to its strong antiseptic potential, EOs have been used since ancient times for treating microbial infections and other illnesses <sup> <a href="#CR13">13</a>, <a href="#CR16">16</a> </sup>. <i>Gaultheria fragrantissima</i> Wall. (Ericaceae) is an evergreen perennial shrub widely distributed in the Himalayas and the northeastern region of India <sup> <a href="#CR17">17</a> </sup>. The EO of leaves contains volatile organic ester, methyl salicylate that can serve as an effective natural source of the commonly used pain reliever, aspirin <sup> <a href="#CR18">18</a> </sup>. However, due to its volatile nature, low bioavailability and high degradation rate, the real application of <i>G</i>. <i>fragrantissima</i> EOs is limited. </p> <p>In recent years, nanomaterials are emerging as efficient tools to deliver lipophilic drugs and molecules <sup> <a href="#CR19">19</a>– <a href="#CR24">24</a> </sup>. Among them, nanoemulsion (NE) of EOs with suitable delivery systems is an appropriate strategy to overcome these obstacles. NEs are a mixture of oil and water phases, stabilized with surfactants and has a particle size of less than 200 nm <sup> <a href="#CR25">25</a> </sup>. Oil in water (O/W) type NEs are excellent carriers for delivery of EOs because of their potential to solubilize large quantity of EOs and to protect them from evaporation, hydrolysis, and degradation <sup> <a href="#CR26">26</a>, <a href="#CR27">27</a> </sup>. Moreover, the fabrication of antimicrobial hydrogels using NEs becomes an emerging technology in recent years. Hydrogels are a promising class of materials fabricated from natural or synthetic polymers that display 3D network structures with high to ultra-high degree of water content <sup> <a href="#CR28">28</a>– <a href="#CR31">31</a> </sup>. Due to their high hydrophilicity, complex three-dimensional network, unique biocompatibility, and cell adhesion, hydrogels are one of the suitable biomaterials for the development of surface coatings in preventing and treating multidrug-resistant infections <sup> <a href="#CR19">19</a> </sup>. Currently, there is a great deal of research going on in the area of developing antimicrobial hydrogel-based coatings of plant-derived phytochemicals and EOs. The EO of <i>G</i>. <i>fragrantissima</i> has been reported to be having insecticidal, nematicidal, antioxidant and antibacterial activities <sup> <a href="#CR32">32</a> </sup>. However, anti-biofilm and anti-virulence properties of its EO and bioactive compounds have not been reported so far. Therefore, there was a specific interest in developing NE-loaded hydrogel coatings of bioactive compounds of <i>G</i>. <i>fragrantissima</i> EO for antimicrobial application. </p> </div> <div class="results" title="results"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Characterization of NEs</div> <p>O/W type NEs were prepared from EO of wild <i>G</i>. <i>fragrantissima</i> (WGF) leaves and commercial grade EO of <i>G</i>. <i>fragrantissima</i> (CGF) using Tween-80 (surfactant), propylene glycol (co-surfactant), and distilled water (DW). The volumes of EO (5%), the non-ionic surfactant and emulsifier (S) (Tween 80; 0.2%), co-surfactant (CS) (propylene glycol; 0.1%) and DW in the ratio of 5(EO):0.2(S):0.1(CS):94.7(DW) were used to prepare the NE. The mixture was sonicated using a 20 kHz sonicator with a maximum power output of 750 W for 20 min while maintaining the sample in an ice-bath. The mean droplet diameter of 9.295 ± 0.5 nm (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1a</a>) and 9.922 ± 0.7 nm (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1b</a>) with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.321 and 0.356 of WFG-NE and CGF-NE, respectively was measured by Litesizer-500 particle size analyzer (Anton Paar, Australia). The PDI less than 0.4 indicated that the NE droplets were mono-dispersed. To determine the shape and morphology of the prepared NEs, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed. The obtained NEs were spherical in shape with a particle size ranging from 5–15 nm in diameter for WGF-NE (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1c</a>) and 6–16 nm for CGF-NE (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1d</a>). The average particle size was also determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and it was found to be 8.3 ± 1.2 nm for WGF-NE (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1e</a>) and 19.1 ± 2.82 for CGF-NE (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1f</a>). The prepared WGF-NE was stable even after being subjected to centrifugation for 20 min at 10,000 rpm at room temperature. WGF-NE was found to be more stable when stored at 4 °C, −20 °C and 45 °C as compared to CGF-NE. Both phase separation and creaming were not detected when stored at room temperature for 90 days (Table <a href="#MOESM1">S1</a>). </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 1</span> </a> </div>   <p>Characterization of NEs.

Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and sub-MIC</div> <p>MICs of EOs and NEs were determined against ECOH using growth kinetics assay. MIC was evaluated as the lowest concentration that exhibited entire suppression of the visible growth. The MIC values of CGF-EO and CGF-NE were 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively. While, WGF-EO and WGF-NE exhibited MIC at the concentration of 0.3% and 0.025%, respectively (Table <a href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Next, sub-MIC levels of the test samples were determined by flow cytometry and bacterial growth curve analyses. When the cells were exposed to 0.1% of CGF-EO and 0.01% of CGF-NE, no significant reduction of ECOH cell viability was determined (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2</a>). Moreover, WGF-EO at 0.05% and WGF-NE at 0.005% did not show any cidal effects (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2</a>). Similar results were also recorded in the growth curve analysis (Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">S1a–d</a>). Cell viability analysis was performed using a fluorescence microscope to further confirm the MIC and sub-MIC values of WGF-EO and WGF-NE. Cell death was not observed when ECOH treated with sub-MIC levels (Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">S2</a>). Moreover, sub-MIC values of CGF-EO and CGF-NE were also not found to induce cell death (data not shown). The sub-lethal concentrations would not possibly enforce a discriminating pressure to elevate drug resistance in ECOH. Hence, sub-lethal concentrations of CGF-EO, CGF-NE, WGF-EO, and WGF-NE were selected for anti-biofilm and anti-virulence experiments. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 2</span> </a> </div>   <p>Sub-MIC and MIC determination against ECOH using fluorescence microscopy.

Anti-biofilm Bioactive Chemicals of Eos</div> <p>To identify the bioactive chemical constituents of CGF-EO and WGF-EO, gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis was performed. EO from the leaves of wild <i>G</i>. <i>fragrantissima</i> was extracted using Clevenger apparatus and EO yield was 1.1%. GC–MS analysis of EOs showed the presence of 12 and 10 compounds in WGF-EO (Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">S3a</a>) and CGF-EO (Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">S3b</a>), respectively. The major chemical constituents of WGF-EO were methyl salicylate (98%), phenol 2-methoxy-3-2 propenyl (0.98%), and eugenol (0.6%). While methyl salicylate (&amp;gt;99%) and 2-hexenal (0.28%) were major compounds in CGF-EO (Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>). The results are in accordance with that of previous studies, in which the EO of <i>G</i>. <i>fragrantissima</i> leaves has more than 93% methyl salicylate <sup> <a href="#CR33">33</a> </sup>. However, the current study reported for the first time having eugenol as a bioactive compound in WGF-EO.

However, methyl salicylate required 0.025% for the inhibition of 80% ECOH biofilm formation (Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">S4a</a>). In addition, the anti-biofilm activity of eugenol and methyl salicylate was further confirmed by CV staining assay and fluorescent microscopy. However, phenol 2-methoxy-3-2 propenyl and 2-hexanal did not exhibit anti-biofilm activity at the concentration of 0.05% (data are not shown). These results suggest that eugenol and methyl salicylate were mostly accountable for the anti-biofilm activity of <i>G</i>. <i>fragrantissima</i> EO. <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 2</span>  </div></p><p>GC-MS analysis of WGF-EO and CGF-EO.</p>  <table> <thead> <tr> <th>RT (min)</th> <th>Compound name</th> <th>Composition (%) <sup>a</sup> </th> </tr> <tr> <th>WGF-EO</th> <th>CGF-EO</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>8.16</td> <td>Trans 3-hexen-1-ol</td> <td>0.07</td> <td>0.05</td> </tr> <tr> <td>8.67</td> <td>2-Hexenal</td> <td>0.05</td> <td> <b>0.28</b> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>12.83</td> <td>Beta-terpineol acetate</td> <td>—</td> <td>0.03</td> </tr> <tr> <td>12.85</td> <td>D-Limonene</td> <td>—</td> <td>0.03</td> </tr> <tr> <td>13.89</td> <td>Eucalyptol</td> <td>0.05</td> <td>—</td> </tr> <tr> <td>16.76</td> <td>Beta-linalool</td> <td>0.02</td> <td>0.01</td> </tr> <tr> <td>17.33</td> <td>2-Myristynonyl pantetheine</td> <td>—</td> <td>0.02</td> </tr> <tr> <td>20.57</td> <td>4-Terpineol</td> <td>0.01</td> <td>—</td> </tr> <tr> <td>21.51</td> <td>5,8,11-heptadecatrien-1-ol</td> <td>0.02</td> <td>0.01</td> </tr> <tr> <td>23.59</td> <td>Methyl salicylate</td> <td> <b>97.85</b> </td> <td> <b>99.38</b> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>25.71</td> <td>Ethyl salicylate</td> <td>—</td> <td>0.03</td> </tr> <tr> <td>29.13</td> <td>Phenol 2-methoxy-3-2 propenyl</td> <td> <b>0.98</b> </td> <td>—</td> </tr> <tr> <td>29.40</td> <td>Trans-m-propenyl guaicol</td> <td>—</td> <td>0.04</td> </tr> <tr> <td>29.81</td> <td>Beta-curcumene</td> <td>0.08</td> <td>—</td> </tr> <tr> <td>30.84</td> <td>7-Epi cis sesquisabinene</td> <td>0.01</td> <td>—</td> </tr> <tr> <td>34.84</td> <td>6-Epi shyobunol</td> <td>0.01</td> <td>—</td> </tr> <tr> <td>35.31</td> <td>Eugenol</td> <td> <b>0.60</b> </td> <td>—</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="table-wrap-foot_UNKNOWN"> <p>RT, retention time (minutes).</p> <p>Components present in EOs at greater than 0.2% are indicated by bold font.</p> <p> <sup>a</sup>Percentages were calculated based on normalized FID peak areas. </p> </div>  <p /> <p>The antimicrobial activity of eugenol and methyl salicylate was studied by measuring MIC and ECOH planktonic growth.

The mean droplet diameter of eugenol-NE and methyl salicylate-NE droplets were 9.389 ± 0.2 nm and 10.81 ± 0.4 nm and PDI 0.345 and 0.371, respectively (Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">S5a,b</a>). The droplet size measured using SEM was compared with the average droplet diameter measured by the particle size analyzer (Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">S5c,d</a>). Previous studies have found that NEs of various EOs have a spherical shape and 15–200 nm average droplet size <sup> <a href="#CR34">34</a> </sup>. Figure <a href="#MOESM1">S5e,f</a> showed brightfield microscopic images of NEs and these droplets were spherical in shape.

The prepared NEs were found to be highly stable when stored at 4 °C, −20 °C and 45 °C for a period of 90 days (data not shown). No alternations in droplet diameter were noticed. Moreover, neither phase separation nor creaming was recorded. MIC values of eugenol-NE and methyl salicylate-NE were 10-times lower than bulk eugenol and methyl salicylate (Table <a href="#MOESM1">S4</a>). Eugenol-NE and methyl-salicylate-NE exhibited sub-lethal values at the concentration of 0.0005% and 0.0025% respectively, measured by flow cytometry (Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4a,b</a>) and growth kinetics assay (Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">S6a,b</a>).

Anti-virulence Activity of Eugenol-NE and Methyl Salicylate-NE</div> <p>The production of LPS is a key phenotypic virulence factor of ECOH that play a key role in biofilm formation, architecture and maturation <sup> <a href="#CR35">35</a> </sup>. In the present study, LPS was fractionated from treated or untreated ECOH cultures and measured spectrophotometrically.

Because motility plays a key role in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> biofilm formation, we also examined the impact of NEs on flagellar function through measurement of swimming and swarming motilities. Eugenol-NE (0.0005%) and methyl salicylate-NE (0.0025%) decreased swimming and swarming motilities of ECOH (Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">S9b</a>).

Therefore, we assessed the effect of NEs on curli fimbriae formation by SEM and Congo red staining assay.

However, at the same concentrations, bulk eugenol and methyl salicylate did not reduce the production of LPS, curli fimbriae formation, and motility in ECOH. The superior inhibitory effect of NEs over bulk eugenol and methyl salicylate might be due to their large surface area and small droplet size of NEs which permitted eugenol and methyl salicylate to interact more efficiently with fimbriae formation in ECOH cells. </p> </div> <div class="effectofeugenol-neandmethylsalicylate-neonvirulencegenesexpression" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Discussion</div> <p> <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> infection is a major problem worldwide owing to the emergence of multi-drug resistance biofilms and due to the lack of effective therapy. The current investigation demonstrates that the stable NEs of <i>G</i>. <i>fragrantissima</i> EO and its bioactive compounds showed superior anti-biofilm property than pure EO against ECOH without altering its cell viability. The inhibition of biofilm formation could be an attractive option to inhibit cell growth by antibiotics because it does not enforce a selective pressure, and thus the risk of drug resistance is less likely to develop. Current investigation using the bioactive compounds of EO and their NEs proved the anti-biofilm activity of eugenol, identified in the EO of WGF and methyl salicylate, identified in both WGF as well as CGF OEs. Biochemical and transcriptional experiments presented evidence regarding the mechanism of biofilm inhibition and virulence reduction by eugenol-NE and methyl salicylate-NE (Fig. <a href="#Fig9">9</a>). Furthermore, NEs of eugenol and methyl salicylate remarkably inhibited ECOH biofilm formation on solid surfaces such as glass, plastic and meat pieces. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 9</span> </a> </div>   <p>A schematic diagram explaining the mechanism of anti-biofilm and anti-virulence activities of NEs of <i>G</i>. <i>fragrantissima</i>. </p>   </div> <p /> <p>Anti-biofilm and anti-virulence properties of eugenol-NE and methyl salicylate-NE were due to the suppression of LPS production, motility, fimbriae production and biofilm-related genes in ECOH <sup> <a href="#CR37">37</a>, <a href="#CR38">38</a> </sup>. It is well-documented that LPS production and fimbriae formation are major virulence factors which play a key role in biofilm formation. The bacterial strains develop different types of fimbriae, including curli fimbriae, type I fimbriae, pilus, F9 fimbriae, and other fimbrial proteins <sup> <a href="#CR39">39</a> </sup>. Eugenol is a volatile chemical of several plants belonging to the Lamiaceae, Lauraceae, Myrtaceae, and Myristicaceae families <sup> <a href="#CR29">29</a> </sup>. A large number of scientific studies suggests that eugenol exerts strong anti-biofilm potential and antimicrobial activity which was also tested in several experimental model systems <sup> <a href="#CR16">16</a> </sup>. Earlier studies have reported that the bioactive compounds of EOs such as eugenol, cinnamaldehyde, coumarin, and thymol reduce biofilm formation in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> through attenuation of curli fimbriae production <sup> <a href="#CR13">13</a>, <a href="#CR40">40</a>, <a href="#CR41">41</a> </sup>. Recently, a study revealed that NEs of EOs of cumin, pepper, and fennel inhibit biofilm formation and LPS production in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> and other food borne bacteria <sup> <a href="#CR14">14</a> </sup>. Therefore LPS and fimbriae inhibiting potential of plant EOs are already well documented and the inhibition by the NEs of bioactive compounds of EOs can be considered as a potential target for attenuation of ECOH biofilm formation. </p> <p>To date, a number of EOs have been reported to suppress quorum sensing and biofilm formation in various pathogenic bacteria <sup> <a href="#CR42">42</a> </sup>. Previous studies have shown that eugenol possesses anti-biofilm activity against <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> <sup> <a href="#CR43">43</a>– <a href="#CR45">45</a> </sup>. The current study demonstrates for the first time that <i>G</i>. <i>fragrantissima</i> EOs as well as NEs of eugenol and methyl salicylate have anti-biofilm activity against ECOH, and elucidates the mechanisms of action involved. Moreover, methyl salicylate and its NE has been reported for the first time for anti-biofilm activity. Methyl salicylate and eugenol are used in topical analgesic oils, creams, perfumes, flavoring agents, and local antiseptic and anesthetic products <sup> <a href="#CR46">46</a> </sup>. Methyl salicylate is abundantly found in <i>G</i>. <i>fragrantissima</i> EO and eugenol is found in clove oil. The study suggests new application of <i>G</i>. <i>fragrantissima</i> EO to prevent ECOH biofilm formation on solid surfaces. </p> <p>Shiga-like toxin (STX) is generated by ECOH for attaching to host epithelial cells that causes the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. STX is encoded by LEE genes and is controlled by the <i>ler</i> gene. In the current investigation, the expression of <i>ler</i> and <i>ler</i>-regulated toxin genes ( <i>espD</i>, <i>escJ</i>, <i>escR</i>, and <i>tir</i>) and curli genes ( <i>csgABDFG</i>) was downregulated, when ECOH exposed to NEs of eugenol and methyl salicylate. Furthermore, NEs of eugenol and methyl salicylate also inhibited the expression of genes that regulate LPS production ( <i>waaL</i>), quorum sensing ( <i>luxS</i>, <i>luxR</i> and <i>tnaA</i>), and swarming ( <i>fimA</i> and <i>fimH</i>) and swimming ( <i>flhD</i>, <i>fliA</i>, and <i>motB</i>) motilities. The obtained data suggest that the NEs of eugenol and methyl salicylate can be used as potential inhibitors of biofilm formation and toxin production in LEE-encoding <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> strains <sup> <a href="#CR47">47</a>– <a href="#CR49">49</a> </sup>. </p> <p>In the current study, NEs of <i>G</i>. <i>fragrantissima</i> EOs and their bioactive chemicals namely, eugenol and methyl salicylate effectively inhibited the production of biofilm formation, pathogenicity factors, and expression of virulence genes in ECOH as compared to their bulk forms. In addition, hydrogel coatings containing eugenol-NE and methyl salicylate-NE effectively attenuated ECOH biofilm formation on plastic, glass, and meat surfaces. The obtained data suggests that the NEs of eugenol and methyl salicylate could be ideal candidates for the prevention of biofilm formation and virulence of ECOH on solid surfaces. </p> </div> <div class="materials_methods" title="materials|methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

The specimen was identified using local floras and the voucher specimen was deposited at the herbarium of the CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Lucknow, India. Collected leaves were washed thoroughly in tap water, followed by successive washings in DW. One kilogram of chopped leaves were subjected to hydro-distillation for 4 h using a Clevenger assembly following the procedure described in the Indian Ayurvedic Pharmacopeia Part-I, Volume-V. The amount of EO obtained from 1 kg of chopped fresh leaves of <i>G</i>. <i>fragrantissima</i> was to be 1.1% (w/v). To obtain pure EO, the collected EO was re-extracted with dichloromethane and water content was dried by adding anhydrous sodium sulphate power.

NE Preparation and Characterization</div> <p>Oil in water (O/W) NEs of <i>G</i>. <i>fragrantissima</i> leaves were prepared using EO (5%), S (Tween 80; 0.2%), CS (propylene glycol; 0.1%) and DW in the ratio of 5:0.2:0.1:94.7, respectively. The detailed methodology is provided in the Supplementary Methods section. The particle size of prepared NEs was measured using a particle size analyzer (MAL 1010294 Malvern, Worcestershire, UK). The fluctuation in the scattered light intensity, (Brownian motion) of the NE was measured by the dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique. To avoid multiple scattering effects, NEs were diluted with double DW. To determine the oil droplet dispersion in the NEs, size distribution curves were plotted as a function of intensity (%), Z-average average droplet size (d.nm), and PDI were calculated. Further, SEM was performed to determine the morphology and structure of the prepared NEs. To perform SEM, NEs were diluted 250-fold in with ultra-pure water and mounted on lamels and dried at room temperature. Samples were analyzed using a high-resolution Quanta-250 microscope (FEI, Netherland). TEM (JEM-1010 JEOL, USA) was carried out to determine the size and shape of droplets. For analysis, one drop of NE was negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid and placed on a copper grid. TEM images were obtained using a (JEM-1010 JEOL, USA) at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. For the preparation of eugenol and methyl salicylate NEs, 3% of these compounds, 98.6% of water, 0.3% of Tween-80 and 0.1% of propylene glycol were used. The mixtures were sonicated using a 50 kHz Ultrasonic Processor (GEX 750, USA) under 750 W power output for 15 min in an ice-bath to prevent the evaporation of OEs. For the formation of ultrasonic waves, a 13 mm diameter ultrasound probe was used. To nullify heat energy generation during the ultrasonication process, the sample container was kept in an ice bath. The transparent and clear NEs were obtained and further subjected for characterization and stability analysis. </p> </div> <div class="stabilityofnes" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

To determine curli fimbriae formation, NA plate assay was applied. Briefly, NA media contained NEs, 20 μg/ml of Congo red (Sigma) and 10 μg/ml of Coomassie brilliant blue (Sigma). The plates were inoculated with overnight grown ECOH culture, incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, and evaluated for curli fimbriae formation. The same protocol was followed, except NB medium was used in place of NA in 14-ml round bottom tubes to quantify the curli fimbriae formation. After 24 h of incubation, cultures of ECOH were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 30 min and recorded the OD of the supernatant at A <sub>490</sub>. Also, SEM was used to examine the fimbriae formation.
