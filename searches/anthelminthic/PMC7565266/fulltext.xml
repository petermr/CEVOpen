Despite mass drug administration (MDA) to school-aged children and other control measures, helminth infections are spreading into new areas. Thus, there is a strong rationale for developing anthelminthic vaccines as cost-effective, long-term immunological control strategies, which, unlike MDA, are not haunted by the threat of emerging drug-resistant helminths nor limited by reinfection risk. Advances in vaccinology, immunology, and immunomics include the development of new tools that improve the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of vaccines; and some of these tools have been used in the development of helminth vaccines. The development of anthelminthic vaccines is fraught with difficulty. Multiple lifecycle stages exist each presenting stage-specific antigens. Further, helminth parasites are notorious for their ability to dampen down and regulate host immunity. One of the first significant challenges in developing any vaccine is identifying suitable candidate protective antigens. This review explores our current knowledge in lead antigen identification and reports on recent pre-clinical and clinical trials in the context of the soil-transmitted helminths <italic>Trichuris</italic>, the hookworms and <italic>Ascaris</italic>. Ultimately, a multivalent anthelminthic vaccine could become an essential tool for achieving the medium-to long-term goal of controlling, or even eliminating helminth infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>helminth</kwd><kwd>hookworm</kwd><kwd><italic>Trichuris</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Ascaris</italic></kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>vaccine-induced immunity</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="287"/><page-count count="18"/><word-count count="17238"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) remain a global public health issue. Their impact is especially felt in areas with poor hygiene and sanitation, and are related to extreme poverty and lack of health education (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Some of the most &#x0201c;neglected&#x0201d; diseases are caused by soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), which together infect more than a quarter of the world's population (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The four most prevalent STHs worldwide are the Hookworms <italic>Necator americanus</italic> and <italic>Ancylostoma duodenale</italic>, the roundworm <italic>Ascaris lumbricoides, Strongyloides stercoralis</italic>, together with the whipworm <italic>Trichuris trichiura</italic> (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The highest intensity of infection for <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> and <italic>T. trichiura</italic> is typically seen in school-aged children and adolescents, whilst in hookworm infections infection intensity tends to increase with age, plateauing in to adulthood. Those who travel to and from regions where STH infections are endemic are also at risk of getting infected (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Although little is known about <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> in comparison to <italic>Ascaris, Trichuris</italic> and hookworm despite prevalence estimates of up to 40% in tropical countries (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) there is a growing understanding of the immune response to infection (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, a biochemical understanding of the parasite remains limited and thus, this review will focus on vaccines against the human hookworms (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), whipworm and roundworm (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>The ability to control STH infections currently depends almost exclusively on mass anti-helminthic drug administrations (MDA) such as albendazole or mebendazole to at-risk populations (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) in conjunction with education and improved sanitation including WASH initiatives (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, post-treatment reinfection is common, especially for helminth species such as <italic>Ascaris</italic> and <italic>Trichuris</italic>, where the robust parasite eggs are nearly ubiquitous in the environment. Such extensive contamination of soil with parasite eggs limits the ability of MDA programs, global control and elimination efforts to interrupt the transmission cycle within a community (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Moreover, the appearance of anthelmintic-resistant parasites threatening human drug treatment programmes (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) has increased interest in developing vaccines, or a pan-anthelminthic vaccine to provide a cost-effective, long-term immunological method to control multiple helminth infections (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>This review explores our current knowledge, prospects, and challenges for anti-human STHs vaccine design. Although of significant importance, the review does not cover veterinary vaccines which have been reviewed recently (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). We include the importance of understanding the underpinning immune responses required to eliminate STHs from their host, opportunities for antigen-presenting cell targeting of candidate antigens, and include recent pre-clinical and clinical trials in the context of <italic>Ascaris, Trichuris</italic> and the hookworms.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Prospects and Challenges for Anti-STHs Vaccine Design</title><p>The development of efficient anti-STH vaccines is thought to represent a greater challenge compared to developing anti-bacterial or anti-viral vaccines. This is partly a result of the complex lifecycles of STHs, combined with an incomplete immunological knowledge of the host-parasite interactions and the immune mechanisms conferring protection (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Moreover, STHs have complex genomes and proteomes (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). This complexity makes it difficult to identify antigenic targets for the development of an effective vaccine (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Despite these obstacles, the development of vaccines against the STHs has progressed over the decades.</p><sec><title>Identifying Lead Antigens to Include in Vaccines</title><sec><title>Crude Antigen Preparations</title><p>The earliest anthelmintic vaccines included attenuated or irradiation-killed parasites (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Since this time, extensive studies across many helminth spp have explored the immunogenicity of native molecules excreted and/or secreted by parasites (the so-called ES molecules) (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and parasite-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in promoting resistance to infection (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Excreted and secreted parasite molecules make excellent vaccine candidates as they sit at the host-parasite interface, playing critical roles in both the modulation of host immunity and in inducing Th2-skewed immune responses (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Recombinant Proteins</title><p>Instead of targeting the immune response against a mixture of antigens, a particular antigen from the pathogen can be produced and expressed in a heterologous expression system to focus the immune response toward a specific antigen of the pathogen to prevent the infection (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Such an approach ensures that safer and more reliable vaccines are developed, with an example being the licensed recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). The key therefore to an effective recombinant vaccine is to identify that particular conserved antigen or combination of antigens secreted or extracted from the pathogen that can overcome the low protective immunity naturally generated by the infection (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). However, recombinant vaccines often require an adjuvant and multiple immunizations to elicit a protective and long-lasting immune response (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Moreover, the production of recombinant proteins using bacterial heterologous expressions can prove challenging. Thus, antigens in which proteolytic stability, higher production yield and post-translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation and glycosylation) are needed, other expression systems such as yeast, insect, plant, or mammalian cells should be considered (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Of the most successful helminth recombinant vaccines are the two against hookworm disease caused by Necator americanus, which consist of aspartic protease-1 (Na-APR-1) and glutathione-S-transferase-1 (Na-GST-1). These vaccines are currently in phase 1 of clinical trials (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>DNA Based Vaccines</title><p>The availability of genome sequences opened up the prospect of the DNA vaccine approach to validate novel vaccine candidates individually or combined to improve vaccine elicitation of cell-mediated and mucosal immunity (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). DNA vaccines are simple rings of DNA containing a gene encoding a specific vaccine antigen under the regulation of a promotor (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). DNA vaccine technology has been intensively used to develop vaccines against various pathogens (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), cancer (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), and autoimmune disorders (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). For example, the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (both as a prophylactic and an immunotherapeutic vaccine) (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), Zika virus (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>), and Ebola virus vaccines (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) are currently in clinical trials. Comparatively, little progress has been made toward developing DNA vaccines against parasitic diseases, although several pre-clinical studies have shown promising results against hookworm infections (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>), malaria (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>), leishmaniasis (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>), and schistosomiasis (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). Even though DNA vaccines offer several advantages when compared with recombinant vaccines, such as safety, improper protein folding and production cost, they have not been shown to be sufficient to induce a protective immune response (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). Therefore, DNA encapsulation, plasmid alterations, co-expressing cytokines and heterologous prime-boost approaches have been explored to enhance the immune responses induced by the DNA vaccine (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Epitope-Based Vaccines</title><p>The advent of the genome era and the tremendous advances in immunological and bioinformatics tools have enabled the reverse vaccinology approach (RV) as a new effective strategy for lead antigen identification in vaccine development (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). One of the advantages of the RV approach is that every antigen encoded in the worm genome can be screened <italic>in silico</italic> to determine its ability to induce an immune response (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). Thus, it can overcome some of the limitations of conventional methods of screening vaccine candidates (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). Antigen selection can also be carefully prescribed based on clear inclusion and exclusion criteria. For example, Zawawi et al. employed a systematic, multi-stage process to identify <italic>Trichuris</italic> epitope vaccine antigens based on the RV approach (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). The epitopes were identified from secreted, and surface-exposed proteins and any protein with any degree of homology to humans or mice were excluded to eliminate potential autoimmune reactions. Most of the identified vaccine antigens were stage-specific and had essential functions in the parasite biological process, associated with host-parasite interaction, parasite metabolism, development and fecundity (<xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The Search for a Pan-Anthelmintic Vaccine</title><p>Coinfections with two or multiple STHs are extremely common in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere in the developing countries (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). The three STHs hookworm, <italic>Ascaris</italic> and <italic>Trichuris</italic> also share highly conserved antigens that are likely to have very similar biological functions (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Thus, researchers have proposed a single pan-anthelmintic vaccine against the three major human STHs to generate strong, lasting immunity with minimal side effects (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). RV methodologies have much to offer in this context. Thus, with the availability of parasite genomes and bioinformatics tools to select out IgE-inducing epitopes <italic>in silico</italic>, the development of a pan-anthelmintic vaccine based on protective epitopes from cross-protective antigens may represent an exciting alternative to the use of whole antigens.</p><p>The choice of lead antigen also determines the biomechanical requirements of production, and the design of the laboratory and clinical trials (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). For example, vaccines based on native antigens, are known to generate significant immunity against many STHs in pre-clinical models (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). However, they have many manufactory limitations, such as high cost, time consumption, difficulty of purifying large quantities of worm antigens, low stability, shelf-life, shortage of <italic>in vitro</italic> methods for the culture of parasites and control over differences in batches to develop a commercially stable vaccine (<xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). Approaches such as recombinant (<xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>), DNA (<xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>), and epitope-based vaccines (<xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>) overcome some of the limitations associated with native antigens. However, most vaccines against STHs remain in early-stage development or are undergoing pre-clinical evaluation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Adjuvants: Key Components in Modern Vaccinology</title><p>The effectiveness of lead antigens is often restrained by an inherent lack of immunostimulation. Therefore, efforts have focused on co-administering antigens with vaccine adjuvants as a key component in modern vaccinology, aiming to intensify the immune response and generate effective immunological memory (<xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>). In addition, adjuvants are important in overcoming immune senescence seen in the elderly (<xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>), and expanding the antibody repertoire generated (<xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>). Adjuvants may also allow dose-sparing (<xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>) and careful choice of adjuvants used provides the ability to guide the type of immune response generated (<xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>, <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). The specific type of T helper response generated plays critical role in the efficacy of the protective immune response, as a Th1-type response is critical in developing vaccines against intracellular pathogens, whereas Th2-type responses are critical in developing vaccines against extracellular parasites (<xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>).</p><p>Among the earliest adjuvants used in experimental antibody production were Freund's adjuvants (<xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>, <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>). However, as these adjuvants are associated with pain, inflammation, and tissue destruction they are no longer used and have been replaced by other adjuvants that can produce equal or superior antibody responses with less inflammation and tissue destructions (<xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>).</p><p>The two adjuvants that are licensed for use in humans, aluminum salt and squalene oil-based emulsion (MF59), mainly promote Th2-biased immune responses (<xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>, <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>). Each adjuvant has its own immunological signature. For example, alum increased antibody titers, whereas MF59 induces strong antibody and IL-5 responses in mice (<xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>). However, their mechanisms of action remain only partially understood.</p><p>Nanoparticulate vaccine adjuvants and delivery vehicles have also been incorporated into vaccine design to enhance the humoral and cellular immune responses (<xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>, <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>). Vaccine delivery systems include synthetic nano- and micro-particles, immunostimulatory complexes, liposomes, virosome, and virus-like particles (VLP) (<xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>). These approaches promote the uptake of antigens by different antigen-presenting cells, promote their migration and maturation from the site of vaccine uptake and protect antigens from degradation (<xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>, <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>, <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>). VLPs, for example, possess the immunostimulatory and self-adjuvanting properties of natural viruses but do not contain genetic material (<xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>, <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>). In addition, they are very stable and can withstand adverse environments, such as those with acidic pH, making VLPs an attractive carrier for mucosally administered vaccines (<xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>). RTS, S (Mosquirix) was the first licensed VLP-based vaccine generated against parasitic disease (<xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>). It is composed of three tandem repeat (R) and cell (T) epitopes from the circumsporozoite protein of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria parasite, which are displayed on hepatitis B surface particles (HBs-Ag) (S), co-expressed in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (S) and reconstituted with an AS01 adjuvant (<xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>).

The TLR4 agonists are approved for use in human vaccines and are being studied in leishmaniasis (<xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>), schistosomiasis (<xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>), tuberculosis (<xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>), and influenza vaccines (<xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>). The combination of vaccine antigen with different TLR agonists has also been studied in various formulations such as microparticles, nanoparticles, and lipid emulsions to enhance the immune responses induced by the vaccine (<xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>, <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>). For example, mice immunized with a yellow fever vaccine containing antigens combined with TLR4 and TLR7 agonists and conjugated to synthetic nanoparticles, induced synergistic antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies compared to immunization with antigens coupled with a single TLR ligand (<xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>). Further, an HIV vaccine conjugated with a TLR5 agonist combined to a nanoparticle synthesized from a synthetic poly lactic-<italic>co</italic>-glycolic acid (PLGA) showed increased immunogenicity in a preclinical mouse model and reduced the immunogenic dose of the vaccine candidate (<xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>). Moreover, the formulation of a TLR4 ligand contained within a PLGA-based nanoparticle plus a malaria proteins (Pfs25) noted for its poor immunogenicity, improved vaccine induced-immunity (<xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>).</p><p>Given the range of adjuvants available it is recommended to test several adjuvants or immunostimulants with each potential vaccine antigen at the pre-clinical stage of development in order to optimize the quality of the immune response and to generate effective protective immunity.</p></sec><sec><title>Challenges to Vaccine Development</title><p>Having identified a lead antigen and selected an appropriate adjuvant, other hurdles remain to be overcome in the development of an anti-helminth vaccine.

A recent study also showed that eosinophils were recruited to the site of infection by immune serum activated macrophages, leading to the immobilization of migrating <italic>A. suum</italic> larvae (<xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have also highlighted a variety of Th2 regulated immune-mediated mechanisms associated with <italic>Trichuris</italic> expulsion including epithelial cell turn over (<xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>, <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>), increased muscle hyper-contractility (<xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>), goblet cell hyperplasia and production of mucins (<xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>), with specific Th2 cytokines identified as key.

However, similar Th2-controlled effector mechanisms have been put forward for hookworm (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). For <italic>Ascaris</italic>, liver-stage immunity during the migratory stages of infection has been associated with oxidative phosphorylation and the production of reactive oxygen species (<xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>), the lung-stage with an eosinophilia (<xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>, <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>), and expulsion from the gut with increased muscle contractility (<xref rid="B165" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>).</p><p>The role of the B cells and antibody in helminth infection remains unclear, with roles embracing both antibody production and antibody-independent cellular regulation. Thus, B-cells may play roles in stimulating the generation and/or polarization of T-cell responses by either cytokine secretion or antigen presentation in addition to their more widely appreciated role in antibody production (<xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>, <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>). In mouse models, both antibody-dependent and independent roles for the B cell have been proposed. Using a B-cell depletion strategy in a mouse model, a recent study suggested that the development of a Th2 type immune response to <italic>Trichuris</italic> infection is dependent on the host's genetic background and is independent of antibodies (<xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>). Indeed in the context of <italic>Trichuris</italic> infections, evidence points toward antibody-independent worm expulsion mechanisms (<xref rid="B169" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>, <xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>). However, for other rodent helminths, roles for antibody have been well-documented (<xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>, <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>). For example, parasite-specific IgG1 is thought to play a role in immunity to the rodent hookworm <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus</italic> (<xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>).</p><p>In humans, CD11c+ B cells have been shown to be the main IL-10 producers in Indonesian-STH-infected individuals compared to Europeans and Indonesians not exposed to helminths, inferring a regulatory function (<xref rid="B174" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>). The robust production of total and parasite-specific IgG1 and IgG4 have been associated with age, but may simply reflect the intensity of helminth infection (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>, <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>, <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>). For example, children with repeatedly heavy infections with <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> produced significantly higher levels of <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic>-specific (IgGl, IgG4, and IgE) compared to the repeatedly lightly infected children (<xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>, <xref rid="B176" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>). King et al. also suggested that antibody responses may not predict future levels of infection or confer protection from current infection or re-infection with <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> but may only reflect infection intensity (<xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Trichuris</italic>-specific IgE has been shown to be negatively correlated with infection intensity and positively correlated with age, suggesting that IgE is associated with protection (<xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>, <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>). Total levels of IgE have also been correlated with the activation and degranulation of mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils (<xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>). Further, negative associations between hookworm-specific intestinal and serum IgA and hookworm infection were observed in humans and the hamster model of <italic>A. ceylanicum</italic> hookworm infection, suggesting that antibodies may act in concert with other components of the mucosal and systemic immune response to promote protective immunity against hookworm infection (<xref rid="B179" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>). Overall, data supports the view that B cells are important in immunity to STHs, but the precise mechanisms by which B-cells and antibody support protective immunity remains only partially understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of Host Immunity by STHs&#x02014;A Challenge for Vaccine Development</title><p>Experimental model systems, both rodent and human, have demonstrated that helminth infections regulate host immunity, dampening pathology at the expense of efficient worm expulsion.

Despite a reasonable body of literature from animal models, describing how Th2 immune responses confer protection against STHs in a primary infection, there is very little data regarding the mechanism(s) of vaccine-driven immunity, and this represents a significant gap in our knowledge. Thus, although strong evidence exists to support the need for a vaccine to promote Th2 immune response against STHs in the context of potently regulated environments, how the Th2 immune response culminates in worm expulsion is unknown and may well differ to the Th2 controlled effector mechanisms at play in immunity to a primary infection. Further, we still have little insight into the mechanisms by which vaccines trigger Th1 or Th2 biased immune responses, strong B cell responses or long-lived memory T-cell responses, despite formation of T-cell memory being critical to protection against infectious diseases. Antigen delivery to the right antigen-presenting cells is critically important for the quality of the T-cell response, yet targeting of specific populations of antigen-presenting cells is often a neglected aspect in the design of vaccines.</p><p>There is a substantial evidence base to support the principle of dendritic targeting in vaccine development (<xref rid="B193" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>), although it has not been applied to many vaccines against STHs.

As a result, this vaccine was commercialized in the United States in 1973 for canines. However, it was withdrawn after 2 years because of the high cost, storage, stability, and the lack of sterilizing immunity (<xref rid="B202" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>).</p><p>The human hookworm vaccine initiative of the Sabin Product Development Partnership has been directed toward identifying a hookworm vaccine (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B203" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>).

Indeed, the use of <italic>Ascaris</italic> egg-contaminated sewage sludge in agriculture has meant that, even in Europe, exposure to <italic>Ascaris</italic> is surprisingly common (<xref rid="B237" ref-type="bibr">237</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B239" ref-type="bibr">239</xref>). <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> infects around 819 million people worldwide, with children especially susceptible (<xref rid="B240" ref-type="bibr">240</xref>). <italic>A. suum</italic>, the pig roundworm, causes serious economic losses in meat-producing livestock species worldwide (<xref rid="B241" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>). Both parasites have a cosmopolitan distribution, an identical life cycle and are morphologically, genetically, and antigenically very similar (<xref rid="B242" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>). Consequently, efforts have been made in the past to identify vaccine antigens derived from the larval stages and ultraviolet irradiated attenuated embryonated eggs of the pig roundworm <italic>A. suum</italic> (<xref rid="B246" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>). However, the large size of the pigs, the cost and the complexities of animal husbandry, has driven many researchers to use mice and other rodent hosts as a convenient alternative for purposes of vaccine development (<xref rid="B247" ref-type="bibr">247</xref>). However, it is important to note that there is no rodent model that enables the <italic>Ascaris</italic> parasite to complete its life cycle.</p><p>Over the last decade, efforts have been made to identify crude extracts (<xref rid="B248" ref-type="bibr">248</xref>), recombinant proteins (<xref rid="B249" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>, <xref rid="B250" ref-type="bibr">250</xref>), defined native molecules (<xref rid="B251" ref-type="bibr">251</xref>) and extracellular vesicles (<xref rid="B252" ref-type="bibr">252</xref>) as potential <italic>Ascaris</italic> vaccine candidates. These include the 66 kDa gut antigenic protein, the most immunodominant protein identified from homogenized <italic>A. suum</italic> adult worm fractions (<xref rid="B251" ref-type="bibr">251</xref>), but which was never tested <italic>in vivo</italic> for immunoprophylactic purposes (<xref rid="B251" ref-type="bibr">251</xref>). Other studies have explored targeting nematode haemoglobins as they can break down nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide, thus potentially providing protection against innate host defenses (<xref rid="B253" ref-type="bibr">253</xref>, <xref rid="B254" ref-type="bibr">254</xref>). However, immunizing pigs with <italic>A. suum</italic> hemoglobin (AsHb) in combination with QuilA adjuvant, failed to induce protective immunity following <italic>A. suum</italic> egg challenge (<xref rid="B255" ref-type="bibr">255</xref>).</p><p>Further, targeting nematode haemoglobins may offer cross species protection. For example, passive immunization of mice with a monoclonal antibody (48Eg) against hemoglobin of the nematode <italic>Anisakis pegreffii</italic> prior to infection with <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic> (rodent hookworm) enhanced protective Th2 immunity and significantly reduced worm burdens (<xref rid="B256" ref-type="bibr">256</xref>). This study also showed that 48Eg cross-reacts with the hemoglobin of several nematodes including <italic>A. lumbricoides, N. brasiliensis, Anisakis pegreffii, Pseudoterranova decipiens</italic>, and <italic>Contracaecum</italic> spp.</p><p>The public availability of the genome, and gene expression data for both <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> and <italic>A. suum</italic> (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B243" ref-type="bibr">243</xref>, <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>), also helped in identifying <italic>Ascaris</italic> vaccine peptides based on the RV approach. Indeed a recent study identified CD4 Th cell epitopes in <italic>A. suum</italic> ES products based on <italic>in vitro</italic> antigen processing and quantitative proteomic tools (<xref rid="B257" ref-type="bibr">257</xref>). However, the selected epitopes have yet to be tested <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> for their ability to induce immune responses.</p><p>To date the five major <italic>A. suum</italic> immunodominant antigens tested as possible vaccine candidates are; <italic>A. suum</italic> 16-kilodalton As16 (<xref rid="B249" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>), As14 (<xref rid="B258" ref-type="bibr">258</xref>), As24 (<xref rid="B259" ref-type="bibr">259</xref>), As37 (<xref rid="B260" ref-type="bibr">260</xref>), and As-Enol (enolase) (<xref rid="B247" ref-type="bibr">247</xref>). As14 and As16, identified from the sera of infected mice with <italic>A. suum</italic>, are localized in both larval and adult stages, as well as in the ES products of both the human and pig roundworms (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and are homologous to the <italic>A. ceylanicum</italic> (Ac-16) vaccine candidate (<xref rid="B209" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>). Intranasal immunization of mice with recombinant rAs14 (<xref rid="B258" ref-type="bibr">258</xref>) and rAs16 (<xref rid="B249" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>) expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and coupled with cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), produced significant protection (64 and 58% respectively), compared to non-vaccinated mice following <italic>A. suum</italic> infection. Furthermore, recombinant rAs16 induced a 58% reduction in the recovery of the lung-stage in a pig animal model, associated with high levels of IL-4 and IL-10 and high titers of rAs16-specific mucosal IgA and serum IgG antibody (<xref rid="B261" ref-type="bibr">261</xref>). Through the use of sera from rAs16-CTB immunized mice, As16 was localized to the worm hypodermis and intestine (<xref rid="B249" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>, <xref rid="B261" ref-type="bibr">261</xref>). Sera from rAs16-CTB immunized mice was also shown to inhibit molting of <italic>A. suum</italic> L3 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B261" ref-type="bibr">261</xref>). Interestingly, subcutaneous vaccination of mice with yeast-expressed As16 formulated with Montanide ISA720 adjuvant significantly reduced larval recovery and induced a Th2 immune response against challenge infection. In contrast mice immunized with rAs14 formulated with ISA720 failed to induce protection (<xref rid="B262" ref-type="bibr">262</xref>). Other studies have used plants as alternative, attractive, vaccine producing factories. For example, mice fed with As16-transgenic rice fused with CTB showed a significant reduction in the number of larvae following challenge infection (<xref rid="B263" ref-type="bibr">263</xref>).</p><p>Promising results were seen in mice immunized with the nematode-specific protein (As24) expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and emulsified with Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA), although the potential for translating these studies to man is limited by the choice of adjuvant. The vaccine resulted in a 58% reduction in lung larval burden post-challenge and induced a Th1/Th2-mixed type immune response characterized by elevated levels of IgG, IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-10 (<xref rid="B264" ref-type="bibr">264</xref>). As24 homologous proteins were also identified in <italic>Ascaris lumbricoides</italic> and the dog parasitic nematode <italic>Toxocara canis</italic> (<xref rid="B259" ref-type="bibr">259</xref>). Anti-As24 IgG also inhibited molting of <italic>A. suum</italic> lung stage, suggesting As24 plays a critical role in the development of <italic>Ascaris</italic> larvae (<xref rid="B259" ref-type="bibr">259</xref>). Further, the protective immune response to <italic>A. suum</italic> larvae correlated with the induction of IgG1 and IgM, and not with IgG2 in pigs immunized with As14, and As24 fractions from adult worms (<xref rid="B265" ref-type="bibr">265</xref>, <xref rid="B266" ref-type="bibr">266</xref>).</p><p>It has also been proposed that As37, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, identified from the adult and larval stages as well as in the hypodermis and muscle of <italic>A. suum</italic> is a potential <italic>Ascaris</italic> vaccine candidate (<xref rid="B260" ref-type="bibr">260</xref>, <xref rid="B267" ref-type="bibr">267</xref>). Mice immunized with rAs37 formulated with AddaVax adjuvant induced a significant 49.7% larval worm reduction after challenge infection compared to control animals. Protection was associated with the production of high levels of serological IgG1 and IgG2a and stimulated the production of IL-4, IL5, IL-10, and IL-13 cytokines, suggesting that both Th1 and Th2 immune responses are essential for worm expulsion (<xref rid="B250" ref-type="bibr">250</xref>). Interestingly, the AddaVax adjuvant performed better than the Th1 adjuvant MPLA and the Th2 adjuvant Alhydrogel. Remarkably, sequence analysis revealed that As37 is highly conserved in other STHs including <italic>N. americanus, A. ceylanicum, A. caninum</italic>, and <italic>T. muris</italic>, but not in humans, suggesting that the nematode-conserved antigen could serve as a pan-helminth vaccine antigen (<xref rid="B250" ref-type="bibr">250</xref>).</p><p>The inorganic <italic>A. suum</italic> pyrophosphatase is another promising vaccine candidate expressed throughout the life cycle and localized in the surface and adult reproductive tissues (<xref rid="B268" ref-type="bibr">268</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>A. suum</italic> pyrophosphatase by RNAi has indicated the importance of this phosphatase in larval development and molting (<xref rid="B269" ref-type="bibr">269</xref>). Furthermore, immunization of mice with rAs-PPase expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and formulated with TiterMax Gold adjuvant resulted in &#x0003e;70% protection against the L3 stage, drove a high serum IgG1 response, and significant production of splenic IL-10 (<xref rid="B270" ref-type="bibr">270</xref>, <xref rid="B271" ref-type="bibr">271</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, enolase (As-Enol-1), found in the <italic>A. suum</italic> larva, adult ES and EVs has been shown to play a critical role in larval development (<xref rid="B272" ref-type="bibr">272</xref>, <xref rid="B273" ref-type="bibr">273</xref>), and triggering <italic>in vitro</italic> macrophage nitric oxide production (<xref rid="B274" ref-type="bibr">274</xref>). Vaccination of Kunming mice with recombinant As-Enol-1 leads to a 61.13% reduction (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in larval recovery and elicits a Th1/Th2 (IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10) immune response (<xref rid="B247" ref-type="bibr">247</xref>).</p><p>Gazzinelli-Guimaraes et al. (<xref rid="B248" ref-type="bibr">248</xref>) also evaluated the immunological, potential clinical impact and protective immune responses of three different <italic>Ascaris</italic> extract vaccines formulated with the MPLA adjuvant. Mice immunized with crude extract of adult worm (ExAD) exhibited a significant reduction (51%) in the total number of migrating larvae recovered in the lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage; crude extract of adult worm cuticle (CUT) 59%, and crude extract of infective larvae (L3) (ExL3) 61% compared to the non-immunized mice. Protection was associated with a marked systemic production of <italic>Ascaris</italic>-specific IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses and a significant increase in systemic IL-5 and IL-10 (pre-challenge) and lung IL-10 (post-challenge). ExL3 and CUT protection was also associated with less tissue damage and pulmonary tissue inflammation as well as reduced pulmonary dysfunction following <italic>Ascaris</italic> challenge. Furthermore, the passive transfer of purified antigen-specific IgG antibodies from mice immunized with ExL3, CUT, and ExAD into na&#x000ef;ve mice induced a significant reduction in parasite burdens in lungs of 65, 64, and 64%, respectively (<xref rid="B248" ref-type="bibr">248</xref>). These results suggest that vaccine induced antibodies play a crucial role in reducing larval migration and subsequent larval burden in the lungs.</p><p>Overall, the protective anti-<italic>Ascaris</italic> immunity (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) observed in all the experimental animal model points toward a Th2-biased immune response, associated with the production of high levels of parasite-specific IgG1. Analyses of vaccine-driven immunity has suggested more mixed Th1/Th2 immune responses may be at play (<xref rid="B250" ref-type="bibr">250</xref>); however, over robust Th1-type responses are counter protective. Again, as with hookworm, the immunological mechanisms underpinning vaccine induced immunity to <italic>Ascaris</italic> infections are only partially understood.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Major Ascaris vaccine candidates.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Antigen</bold></th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Vaccine type</bold></th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Protection % (Reduction in lung larval burden)</bold></th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>References</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">As14</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">r-protein</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">64%</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B258" ref-type="bibr">258</xref>, <xref rid="B266" ref-type="bibr">266</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">As16</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">r-protein</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58%</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B249" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>, <xref rid="B261" ref-type="bibr">261</xref>, <xref rid="B262" ref-type="bibr">262</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">As24</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">r-protein</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58%</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B259" ref-type="bibr">259</xref>, <xref rid="B264" ref-type="bibr">264</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">As37</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">r-protein</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">69%</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B275" ref-type="bibr">275</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">As42</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">r-protein</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67%</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B266" ref-type="bibr">266</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Enol-1</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DNA</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61%</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B247" ref-type="bibr">247</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">As66k</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ND</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ND</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B251" ref-type="bibr">251</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; Crude extract of adult worm (ExAD) <break/>&#x02022; Crude extract of adult worm cuticle (CUT) <break/>&#x02022; Crude extract of infective larvae (L3) (ExL3)</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Crude extract</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; ExAD 51% (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) <break/>&#x02022; CUT 59% (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) <break/>&#x02022; ExL3 61% (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001)</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B248" ref-type="bibr">248</xref>)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>ND, Not done; r-protein, Recombinant protein</italic>.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Experimental <italic>Trichuris</italic> Vaccine Candidates</title><p>Historically, the global health community have focused their vaccine research on hookworm and ascariasis and somewhat neglected trichuriasis, despite the fact that trichuriasis is the second most common STH infection after ascariasis (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Around 477 million people are estimated to be infected with <italic>Trichuris</italic> infection, with the highest intensity of infection seen in school-aged children (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>One of the first attempts at identifying a non-living vaccine for <italic>T. trichiura</italic> was conducted in the mouse model <italic>T. muris</italic>, using adult and larval worm somatic antigens to stimulate protective immunity in infected animals (<xref rid="B278" ref-type="bibr">278</xref>). Vaccination of mice with <italic>T. muris</italic> somatic antigens that were isolated from NIH mice and emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant stimulated protective immunity and a 92% reduction in worm burden after infection (<xref rid="B278" ref-type="bibr">278</xref>). Wakelin and Selby (<xref rid="B278" ref-type="bibr">278</xref>) also demonstrated that soluble antigens from the anterior region of adult worms were more effective in stimulating immunity than antigens prepared from the posterior region. <italic>T. muris</italic> adult worm homogenate and ES products from both adult and larval stages have been used in early-stage vaccine development (<xref rid="B279" ref-type="bibr">279</xref>, <xref rid="B280" ref-type="bibr">280</xref>). Route of antigen delivery has also been explored. For example, a level of protection can be achieved against <italic>T. muris</italic> using homogenized adult antigens combined with cholera toxin as an oral vaccine (<xref rid="B281" ref-type="bibr">281</xref>). However, a 100% reduction in worm burden can be achieved through subcutaneous (s.c.) vaccination with adult antigens emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant (<xref rid="B281" ref-type="bibr">281</xref>). Moving to slightly less crude antigen preparations, but also exploring the route of administration, Jenkins and Wakelin (<xref rid="B279" ref-type="bibr">279</xref>) showed that vaccinating mice subcutaneously with 100 &#x003bc;g of the excreted and secreted ES products of adult <italic>T. muris</italic> parasites without adjuvant, was more effective than intraperitoneal vaccination, also in the absence of adjuvant. More recently, Dixon et al. (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>) showed that subcutaneous vaccination of naturally susceptible AKR mice with <italic>T. muris</italic> ES emulsified with Freund's incomplete adjuvant (IFA) induced expulsion of a high-dose infection. This study also described priming of the immune response to subcutaneous vaccination as occurring in peripheral lymph nodes draining the site of vaccination, that the ensuing protective immune response was of a mixed Th1/Th2 type and eluded to the effector mechanisms involving some form of intestinal antibody-mediated cellular immune response (<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>).</p><p>Interest in identifying host protective material in the extracellular vesicle (EV) components within helminth secretions has increased recently (<xref rid="B282" ref-type="bibr">282</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B284" ref-type="bibr">284</xref>).

Vaccination of mice with ES fractions stimulated long-lasting protection against chronic infection characterized by the production of high levels of IL-9 and IL-13. However, the sera from ES vaccinated mice did not protect na&#x000ef;ve mice from <italic>T. muris</italic> chronic infection, suggesting that anti-parasite antibodies did not play a critical role in protection (<xref rid="B285" ref-type="bibr">285</xref>). Shears et al. also demonstrated that vaccination with EVs boosted IgG1 antibody production against <italic>T. muris</italic> ES proteins, suggesting that there is extensive overlap in protein content between the EVs and ES (<xref rid="B276" ref-type="bibr">276</xref>).</p><p>Gomez-Samblas et al. (<xref rid="B277" ref-type="bibr">277</xref>) have also identified a vaccine candidate that potentially could work against a variety of helminth parasites, including <italic>T. muris</italic>. This candidate is based on the recombinant serine/threonine phosphatase 2A from the nematode <italic>Angiostrongylus costaricensis</italic> (rPP2A), formulated as a lipopeptide and conjugated with a self-adjuvant oleic-vinyl sulfone (OVS). Interestingly, intranasal immunization of AKR mice with the vaccine candidate prior to <italic>T. muris</italic> challenge led to a marked reduction in the number of adult parasites. The immunized mice also developed a combined Th17/Th9 response orchestrated by the cytokines IL-25, IL-17, and IL-9 (<xref rid="B277" ref-type="bibr">277</xref>). The same vaccine candidate has also been tested in lambs and was found to provide significant protection against the ovine helminth <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> and <italic>Teladorsagia circumcincta</italic> infection (<xref rid="B286" ref-type="bibr">286</xref>).</p><p>Briggs et al. (<xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>) had developed two vaccines against trichuriasis based on <italic>T. muris</italic> whey acidic protein (rTm-WAP49) and <italic>T. muris</italic> WAP fragment fusion protein (rTm-WAP-F8+Na-GST-1) formulated with Montanide ISA 720 adjuvant. Vaccinating AKR mice with the vaccine candidates three times at 2-week intervals prior to <italic>T. muris</italic> challenge induced a partial reduction in worm burden (48 and 38%, respectively) (<xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>). The authors also showed that both humoral and cellular immune responses were induced and characterized by elevated antigen-specific IgG1 and IgG2c antibodies and Th2 (IL-4, IL-9, and IL-13) cytokines in the draining inguinal LNs, draining mesenteric LNs and spleens of vaccinated mice (<xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>).</p><p>Despite these promising results (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), subunit vaccines often require substantial adjuvant and often do not provide sufficient protective cellular immunity compared with other vaccine approaches (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). Thus, a recent study identified a promising vaccine candidate based on major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) T-cell epitopes identified from the whole genome of the <italic>Trichuris</italic>, incorporated into Hepatitis B core antigen VLP (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). The four epitopes were identified from chitin-binding domain-containing proteins and chymotrypsin-like serine proteases. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies showed that the VLPs were internalized and co-localized in the antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells and macrophages) lysosomes and stimulated the production of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Remarkably, immunization of mice with four VLPs expressing <italic>Trichuris</italic> T-cell epitopes induced a significant reduction in worm burden following challenge infection compared to control animals without the need for an adjuvant. Protection was associated with the induction of a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response characterized by the production of <italic>Trichuris</italic>-specific IgM and IgG2c and the production of mesenteric lymph node-derived Th2 cytokines and goblet cell hyperplasia.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Major Trichuris vaccine candidates.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Antigen/adjuvant</bold></th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Vaccine type</bold></th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Protection % (Reduction in worm burden)</bold></th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>References</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ES/FIA</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Crude</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">97%</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EVs and EVs fractions</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Crude</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Significant reduction (% was not indicated)</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B276" ref-type="bibr">276</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">rPP2A/OVS</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">r-protein</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">97.90%</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B277" ref-type="bibr">277</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; rTm-WAP49/Montanide ISA 720 <break/>&#x02022; rTm-WAP-F8+Na-GST-1/Montanide ISA 720</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">r-protein</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; 48% <break/>&#x02022; 38%</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VLPs expressing <italic>Trichuris</italic> T-cell epitopes</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Epitope-based</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50%</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>OVS, Oleic-vinyl sulfone; FIA, Freund's incomplete adjuvant</italic>.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Conclusion and Lessons Learned</title><p>STH infections are common in the world's poorest people living in low- and middle-income countries and are linked to detrimental effects on maternal and child health. Several studies have been conducted over the years to develop vaccines as cost-effective methods to control STHs infection (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). However, the process of vaccines development against STH parasites is complicated and faces several challenges. Thus, multiple broad-ranging factors have to be taken in to account when developing a protective vaccine to meet the immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy criteria of regulatory institutes such as the US Food and Drug Administration. These include identifying protective antigens that do not trigger unwanted allergic-type immune responses, the best route of administration, the vaccine type and adjuvant to be used and how to elicit protective immunity in the face of regulated immune environments typical of chronic STH infections (<xref rid="B287" ref-type="bibr">287</xref>). Underpinning all these factors is a need to understand the immune response induced by STHs and the nature of vaccine-driven protective immune responses, such that one can strategically design vaccines to drive the right sort of quality of immune response in susceptible hosts. There is a significant problem in vaccinology in that subunit vaccines, which are composed of antigenic proteins, are often poorly immunogenic and fail to stimulate memory immune responses. Furthermore, there is a knowledge gap in understanding the mechanisms of action of vaccines and how they stimulate the required T- and B-cell responses. Targeting of antigen to specific antigen-presenting cell subsets is a promising strategy going forward. Coupling of a monoclonal antibody to antigen poses technical challenges, requiring fusion protein engineering or cross-linking, both of which can fail or produce low yields. However, overcoming these technical barriers is likely to be far-reaching in the context of STHs, where vaccine delivery is likely to occur in the context of pre-existing chronic infections. Despite an increase in STH vaccine research, it remains a disappointing truth that no human anti-STH vaccine currently exists. Among the lessons learned over the last decade is the importance of gaining international pharma company attention and support in order to bring antihelminth vaccines to trials. Further, raising public health awareness of the enormous threat presented by STH infections to the economy and health of at-risk populations, including their impact on susceptibility to other pathogens (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B192" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>) is critical. This has never been more relevant than now, given today's climate of emerging infectious diseases including SARS-CoV-2.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>AZ researched the literature, drafted the manuscript, and compiled the tables.
