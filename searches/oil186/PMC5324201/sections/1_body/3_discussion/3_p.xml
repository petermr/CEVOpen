<p>Primarily, the nutritive value of a protein depends on the capacity to satisfy the needs for nitrogen and essential amino acid. It is indicated that the 
 <italic>A. sowa</italic> L. root protein is probably basic in nature. There is a dearth of information regarding the amino acid profile of the 
 <italic>Anethum sowa</italic> L. root sample to the best our knowledge. Lisiewska (2004) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] reported that leaves of 
 <italic>Anethum graveolens</italic> L. contained rich in essential amino acid than the whole plant where leucine (10.10 for the whole plant and 9.62 for leaves of g/100 g protein) was the highest essential amino acid. Some amino acids like tryptophan, asparagines and glutamine were destroyed by acid hydrolysis method and therefore these acids were not determined. Cystein was not determined because of the rapid oxidation of this compound to form cysteic acid. The total sulphur containing amino acid (5.49 g/100 g protein) was close to having the recommended protein value (5.8 g/100 g) for infants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This value was well above the 39%, considered to be adequate for ideal protein for infant, 26 g/100 g protein for children and 11 g/100 g protein for adult [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The storage of protein (i.e. amino acids) in the different parts of the plant is readily used for germination and seedling growth [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The proteins are considered for its essential amino acid profile due to the inability of the human body to synthesize them. The amino acid profile of the studied root sample suggests that its protein is beneficial for human health.
