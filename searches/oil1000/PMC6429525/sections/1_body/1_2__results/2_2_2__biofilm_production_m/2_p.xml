<p class="p">The obtained preliminary data analyzed in terms of biofilm production modulation and reproducibility led to the selection of two representatives concentrations (3.125 mg/mL and 0.0488 mg/mL). The first concentration was in the range of milligrams while the second one was in the range of micrograms. All 89 EOs were then tested at the two selected concentrations and the biofilm production was measured relatively to untreated bacteria (
