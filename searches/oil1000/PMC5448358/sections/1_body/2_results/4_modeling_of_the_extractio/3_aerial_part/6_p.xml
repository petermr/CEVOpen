 <italic class="italic">trans‐p</italic>‐mentha‐2,8‐dien‐1‐ol is obtained when the amount of water in the plant material is low. The duration of the extraction has very little impact on the content because its coefficient factor is low. The combination of the extraction duration and the residual water content (
