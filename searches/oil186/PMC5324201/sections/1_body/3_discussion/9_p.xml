<p class="p">The brine shrimp cytotoxicity of the plant extract represents a rapid, inexpensive and simple bioassay technique for cytotoxic and anti-tumor activity. This test is also considered to be phototoxic, pesticidal, trypanocidal, antitumor, anticancer, enzyme inhibition and ion regulation activities. The assay indicated that essential oil is half of the vincristine sulphate toxicity. The apiol was reported to decrease the proliferation of human colorectal carcinoma cells (COLO 205) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>]. Moreover, the acaricidal constituent of apiol was isolated by various chromatographic techniques from 
 <italic class="italic">Petroselinum sativum</italic> seeds and showed very strong acaricidal activity. This activity could be related to allyl (−C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>H
 <sub class="sub">5</sub>) and methoxy (−OCH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) functional groups [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>]. The antiproliferative activity of apiol and myristicin of 
 <italic class="italic">Athamanta sicula</italic> L. also reported on human chronic myelogenous leukemia, lung tumor and breast adenocarcinoma cell line activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">62</xref>]. Nonetheless, apiol is known to have powerful insecticidal and synergist effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. Therefore, the cytotoxic activity of the essential oil is due to the apiol compound of the 
 <italic class="italic">A. sowa</italic> root. Furthermore, this essential oil may be helpful for treatment of premature ageing and cancer therapy by preventing oxidative damage through lipid peroxidation. Though it is the first report of cytotoxic activity on the brine shrimp, extensive studies are to be needed to assess the anticancer activity on the cell line of the essential oil and its isolated compound apiol.
