<p class="p">The β-carotene bleaching assay was performed using an emulsion prepared according to Smeriglio et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-ijms-18-01212" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Aliquots of this emulsion (7.0 mL) were mixed with 0.28 mL of sample solution (range 4–0.5 mg/mL). An emulsion without β-carotene was used as control. The reaction mixture was initially recorded at the starting time (
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 0) at 470 nm and then incubated at 50 °C in a water bath for 120 min, with the absorbance recorded every 20 min. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was used as the reference compound and the results were expressed as inhibition (%) of β-carotene bleaching using Equation (1).
