<p>A growing body of evidence suggests that oxidative stress has a key role in several chronic conditions, including metabolic disorders.[
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Considering antioxidant therapy as one of the current treatments for NAFLD, it could be concluded that free radicals are involved in the pathogenesis of fatty liver disease. In the present study, measurement of serum levels of oxidative damage biomarkers including FRAP, LPO, TTM, and MPO demonstrated that anise fruit extract as well as essential oil could improve antioxidant defense mechanisms. As a result, anise fruit is not only useful due to its ability to modify lipid profile but also represents observable
