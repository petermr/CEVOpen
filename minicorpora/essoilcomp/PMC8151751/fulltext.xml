Nevertheless, the development and distribution of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains in pathogenic bacteria, such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Salmonella Typhi</italic> and <italic>Citrobacter koseri</italic>, has become a major society health hazard. Essential oils could serve as a promising tool as a natural drug in fighting the problem with these bacteria. The current study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial effectiveness of tea tree (<italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> (Maiden and Betche) Cheel), rosemary (<italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L.), eucalyptus (<italic>Eucalyptus obliqua</italic> L&#x02019;H&#x000e9;r.), and lavender (<italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> Mill) essential oils. The antimicrobial properties of essential oils were screened against four pathogenic bacteria, <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>S. Tyhpi,</italic> and <italic>C. koseri</italic>, and two reference bacterial strains, while for the testing, the agar well diffusion method was used. Gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometric (GC&#x02013;MSD) analyses were performed on essential oils. The obtained results showed that <italic>M. alternifolia</italic> essential oil is the richest in terpinen-4-ol, <italic>R. officinalis</italic> and <italic>E. oblique</italic> essential oils in 1,8-cineole, and <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> essential oil in &#x003b1;-terpinyl acetate. In addition, the main bioactive compounds present in the essential oil of tea tree are rich in &#x003b1;-pinene (18.38%), limonene (7.55%) and &#x003b3;-terpinene (14.01%). The essential oil of rosemary is rich in &#x003b1;-pinene (8.38%) and limonene (11.86%); eucalyptus essential oil has significant concentrations of &#x003b1;-pinene (12.60%), <italic>p</italic>-cymene (3.24%), limonene (3.87%), and &#x003b3;-terpinene (7.37%), while the essential oil of lavender is rich in linalool (10.71%), linalool acetate (9.60%), &#x003b1;-terpinyl acetate (10.93%), and carbitol (13.05%) bioactive compounds, respectively. The obtained results from the in vitro study revealed that most of the essential oils exhibited antimicrobial properties. Among the tested essential oils, tea tree was discovered to demonstrate the strongest antimicrobial activity. The recorded MIC of <italic>S. Typhi</italic> was 6.2 mg/mL, 3.4 mg/mL of <italic>C. koseri</italic>, 3.1 mg/mL of <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 2.7 mg/mL of <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922, compared to <italic>M. alternifolia</italic>. Similarly, only <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 showed antimicrobial activity towards <italic>R. officinalis</italic> (1.4 mg/mL), <italic>E. oblique</italic> (2.9 mg/mL), and <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> (2.1 mg/mL). Based on the obtained results, it is possible to conclude that tea tree essential oil might be used as an ecological antimicrobial in treating infectious diseases caused by the tested pathogens.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>antibiotic resistance</kwd><kwd>microbes</kwd><kwd>essential oils</kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. aureus</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S.

Many aromatic and medicinal plants, herbs, and spices have been proposed as a significant source of natural antimicrobials as an alternative to synthetic drugs to treat bacterial infections [<xref rid="B6-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Medicinal plants and the essential oil extracted from them due to the high concentration of bioactive compounds have been widely used for this purpose [<xref rid="B7-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It has been proven that essential oils have been used to treat urinary tract infectious diseases [<xref rid="B10-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], respiratory diseases [<xref rid="B11-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], intestinal disorders [<xref rid="B12-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and dermal illnesses [<xref rid="B13-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Tea tree (<italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> (Maiden and Betche) Cheel), rosemary (<italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>), eucalyptus (<italic>Eucalyptus obliqua</italic> L&#x02019;H&#x000e9;r.), and lavender (<italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> Mill) are aromatic and medicinal plants that belong to two different botanical families. With industrial development, especially in the past twenty years, large efforts have been made to identify and quantify these plants&#x02019; phenolic components [<xref rid="B9-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B14-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

A series of studies have shown the positive effect of essential oils and their bioactive compounds thymol and carvacrol due to several biological properties: antioxidant [<xref rid="B16-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], antimicrobial [<xref rid="B17-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], antiviral [<xref rid="B18-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], diaphoretic [<xref rid="B19-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], expectorant [<xref rid="B20-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], insecticidal [<xref rid="B21-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and genotoxic [<xref rid="B22-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Due to their typical aroma and proximate composition, tea tree, rosemary, eucalyptus, lavender, are commonly utilized in agriculture, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries, respectively.</p><p>Research on extracts of both Myrtle and Lamiaceae family plant chemicals has investigated their composition and their other beneficial properties in in vitro and in vivo experiments [<xref rid="B23-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. As they are secondary plant metabolites, the concentration is influenced by genetic and paragenetic factors, so the constant investigation and determination of their concentrations in plants are of high importance [<xref rid="B25-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In recent decades, <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> have accounted for the most significant number of outbreaks, cases, and deaths worldwide [<xref rid="B1-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To decrease health hazards and economic losses due to the emergence of these pathogens, the use of natural antibacterial alternatives seems to be an appealing way to control the incidence of pathogenic bacteria [<xref rid="B26-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p><italic>Salmonella Tyhpi</italic> is most often the cause of typhoid fever, which is a profoundly severe intrusive bacterial disease of humans. <italic>S.

A distinctive characteristic of <italic>Citrobacter koseri</italic> is the exceedingly elevated tendency to initiate brain abscesses in neonatal meningitis. Earlier reports and studies on infant rats have documented many <italic>Citrobacter</italic>-filled macrophages within the ventricles and brain abscesses.

The results shown in <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00546-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> present the most dominant subgroup of the bioactive compound of each investigated essential oil.</p><p>Conducted analyses show that the tea tree essential oil is richest in terpinen-4-ol, rosemary and eucalyptus essential oils in 1,8-cineole, and lavender essential oil in &#x003b1;-terpinyl acetate, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00546-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Nevertheless, investigated essential oils in our research came with a declaration of origin, but the lack of regulation of the chemical composition of essential oils and the growing popularity of these oils among consumers present an urgent need for the accurate characterization of various oil types from a variety of manufacturers. Many essential oils in retail stores contain chemical substances of adulterants with potential toxicity [<xref rid="B34-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In addition to the main bioactive compounds, the results of our research showed that the essential oil of tea tree is rich in &#x003b1;-pinene (18.38%), limonene (7.55%), and &#x003b3;-terpinene (14.01%), respectively. Obtained results showed that rosemary essential oil was rich in &#x003b1;-pinene (8.38%) and limonene (11.86%); eucalyptus was rich in &#x003b1;-pinene (12.60%), <italic>p</italic>-cymene (3.24%), limonene (3.87%), and &#x003b3;-terpinene (7.37%); and lavender was rich in linalool (10.71%), carbitol (13.05%), linalool acetate (9.60%), and &#x003b1;-terpinyl acetate (10.93%), respectively.</p><p>The two most popular essential oils on the market are tea tree and lavender oil [<xref rid="B34-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Dubnicka et al. [<xref rid="B34-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] investigated the adulteration of essential oils, which showed that six store brand essential oils, tea tree, lavender, sandalwood, rose, eucalyptus, and lemongrass, contained carbitol in concentrations from 23% to 35%, and four of the six oils contained diethyl phthalate in concentrations ranging from 0.33% to 16%. These toxicants are particularly concerning because they are known inhalation hazards, and the intended usage of these oils is for aromatherapy [<xref rid="B34-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Based on our results and the high concentration of carbitol (13.05%) in lavender essential oil, we can assume that our lavender essential oil was not natural, which was revealed by the high concentration of carbitol as the contaminant and should be pointed out as a possible threat. Alpha-pinene presents a polyphenolic terpene organic compound [<xref rid="B35-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It has been reported that &#x003b1;-pinene is a strong antioxidant agent which inhibits prostaglandin E1 and NF-&#x003ba;B and thus contributes to its anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic effects. Terpene is a part of many medical, aromatic, and spice plants [<xref rid="B36-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Research has shown that limonene is usually found in oils obtained from citrus plants, but it has also been found in cannabis. Limonene is used to performed the percutaneous transfer of medicines in vitro and in vivo [<xref rid="B37-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Gamma-terpinene is one of four isomeric monoterpenes. It is a naturally occurring terpenine and has been isolated from many different botanical sources [<xref rid="B38-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It has the highest boiling point of the four known terpnine isomers (&#x003b1;-terpinine, &#x003b2;-terpinene, and &#x003b4;-terpinine). It is a major component of various essential oils and has strong antioxidant activity [<xref rid="B39-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It has a lemon-like or lime-like odor that is most commonly used in the food, aroma, soap, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, tobacco, clothing and perfume industries.</p><p>Many experiments have shown the positive influence of these bioactive compounds found in essential oils, which was the topic of our research. Hendel et al. [<xref rid="B31-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] in their research analyzed essential oils from the aerial parts of 15 samples of Algerian rosemary. The GC-MSD, as in our study, for the determination of phenolic compound was used. Thirty-eight components were characterized, with the highest share of &#x003b1;-pinene, camphene, and limonene as the main components; camphor, 1,8-cineole, and borneol as the principal oxygenated substances; caryophyllene, &#x003b1;-bisabolol, and humulene as the most represented sesquiterpenes. Furthermore, Hendel et al. [<xref rid="B41-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] evaluated essential oils for their antimicrobial activity against <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> and against ten fungal strains belonging to Aspergillus <italic>Alternaria</italic>, <italic>Candida</italic>, <italic>Fusarium</italic>, <italic>Penicillium</italic>, and <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> species, where the results showed moderate antimicrobial activity. Our results showed that eucalyptus essential oil is richest in eucalyptol (1,8-cineole), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00546-f001">Figure 1</xref>), while significant concentrations of &#x003b1;-pinene (12.60%), <italic>p</italic>-cymene (3.24%), limonene (3.87%), and &#x003b3;-terpinene (7.37%) were reordered, respectively (<xref rid="antibiotics-10-00546-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Eucalyptus essential oil, as well as rosemary, poses numerous beneficial properties. For example, phenolic compounds, such as camphene, &#x003b1;-pinene, and 2-phenyl ethanol, have high insecticidal properties of eucalyptus essential oil, so they present a potential candidate for application in integrated pest management approaches [<xref rid="B42-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Reyes et al. [<xref rid="B33-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] confirmed the fumigant and repellent action of eucalyptus essential oil against <italic>Hypothenemus hampei</italic>. The toxic effect of eucalyptus essential oil on the coffee berry borer is due to a synergistic effect involving 1,8-cineole, &#x003b1;-pinene, and <italic>p</italic>-cymene, according to investigations of Reyes et al. [<xref rid="B43-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Results of our study showed that the essential oil of lavender was rich in linalool (10.71%), linalool acetate (9.60%), and &#x003b1;-terpinyl acetate (10.93%) bioactive compounds, respectively. Additionally, we found a significant concentration of carbitol (13.05%) in investigated lavender essential oil, which is a particular indication of essential oil adulteration. Our assumptions have also been confirmed by another study [<xref rid="B34-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In addition to the bioactive compounds that we isolated from lavender essential oil in our research, Yadikar et al. [<xref rid="B44-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] reported results that indicate isolations of seven new bioactive compounds from lavender. The same authors reported that they isolated lavandunat, lavandufurandiol, lavandufluoren, lavandupyrones A and B, and lavandudiphenyls A and B, along with five known compounds, benzoic acid, methyl propanoate, rosmarinic acid, and isosalvianolic acid C, from the ethyl acetate extract of the remaining material, which was obtained from lavender essential oil. According to the research of Sen et al. [<xref rid="B45-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], in addition to the aforementioned essential oils, stated that the most produced peppermint essential oil in the Indian market also often has a high concentration of carbitol, which indicates adulteration. We also come to the same conclusion regarding the usage of lavender essential oil in our study. Donadu et al. [<xref rid="B46-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] investigated the in vitro activity of lavender essential oil against drug-resistant strains of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Bearing in mind that lavender essential oil has been used for its anti-inflammatory, antidepressant, antiseptic, antifungal, and antimicrobial properties, the positive result in this research was expected. Donadu et al. [<xref rid="B35-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] showed that lavender essential oil did not possess a cytotoxic effect when administered in very low concentration, while the same essential oil significantly reduced nitric oxide synthase activity on murine macrophages, which was also evaluated. Increased drug resistance and the absence of new antibiotics can promote the production of natural antimicrobial replacements, which is in agreement with numerous investigations of Puva&#x0010d;a et al. [<xref rid="B47-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00546-f002">Figure 2</xref> presents the peaks of chromatography analysis of the essential oils of tea tree (a), rosemary (b), eucalyptus (c), and lavender (d) used in this research.</p><p>The bioactive compounds of essential oils were tentatively identified (<xref rid="antibiotics-10-00546-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All investigated essential oils in our research with their main components exhibit a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, which can be principally attributed to terpinen-4-ol (tea tree), 1,8-cineole (rosemary and eucalyptus), and carbitol (lavender), as active substances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00546-f001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>All worldwide countries, developed or developing, are equally affected by antibiotic resistance [<xref rid="B48-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].

This emergence and antibiotic resistance emergence have led to a search for new antimicrobial substances of natural origin. Essential oils are known to be rich in bioactive compounds with numerous curative properties [<xref rid="B50-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].

The tested pathogenic bacteria are repeatedly implicated in the occurrence of many diseases [<xref rid="B51-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].

Tea tree oil showed the best overall antimicrobial effect [<xref rid="B59-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of tea tree essential oil has been known for a long time. Li et al. [<xref rid="B52-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] investigated the dynamics and mechanism of its antimicrobial activities of tea tree essential oil in two bacterial strains. Poisoned food technique assessment showed that the MICs of tea tree essential oil for <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> were 1.08 and 2.17 mg/mL, respectively. Antimicrobial dynamic curves showed that with increasing concentrations of essential oil, the rate of cell killing and the duration of the growth lag phase increased correspondingly [<xref rid="B52-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The essential oil of tea tree exhibited a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. Its mode of action against the Gram-negative bacterium <italic>E. coli</italic> and the Gram-positive bacterium <italic>S. aureus</italic> was investigated using various methods. It has been reported that the exposure of these organisms to minimum inhibitory concentrations of tea tree oil inhibit respiration and increase the permeability of bacterial cytoplasmic and yeast plasma membranes [<xref rid="B60-antibiotics-10-00546" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>The antimicrobial efficiency of essential oils was also determined by measuring the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00546-f003">Figure 3</xref>.

Material and Methods</title><p>Commercially available essential oils of tea tree, rosemary, eucalyptus, and lavender used in this research were purchased from a local distributor in Novi Sad, Serbia. According to certification, essential oils from plants were extracted using supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> in the conventional semi-continuous method to separate 1,8-cineole, linalool, linalyl acetate, and camphor.</p><p>Gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometric (GC&#x02013;MS) analyses were performed using an Agilent 7890A GC equipped with an inert 5975C XL EI/CI mass spectrometer detector (MSD) and flame ionization detector (FID) connected by a capillary flow technology 2-way splitter with make-up. The HP-5MS capillary column (30 m &#x000d7; 0.25 mm &#x000d7; 0.25 &#x003bc;m) was used. The GC oven temperature was programmed from 60 to 300 &#x000b0;C at a rate of 3 &#x000b0;C min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and held for 15 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at 16.255 psi (constant pressure mode). An auto-injection system (Agilent 7683B Series Injector - Agilent Technologies Inc, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was employed to inject 1 &#x003bc;L of sample. The sample was analyzed in the splitless mode. The injector temperature was 300 &#x000b0;C and the detector temperature 300 &#x000b0;C. MS data were acquired in the EI mode with a scan range of 30&#x02013;550 m/z, source temperature of 230 &#x000b0;C, and quadruple temperature of 150 &#x000b0;C; the solvent delay was 3 min.</p><p>The identification of all compounds in the analyses was matched by comparing their linear retention indices (relative to C8&#x02013;C36 n-alkanes on the HP-5MSI column) and MS spectra with those of authentic standards from NIST11 databases.</p><p>Previously used structural, physical, and standard biochemistry assessments were used to pinpoint bacterial strains, followed by an antimicrobial susceptibility test by a modified Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Resistant isolates were identified as the isolates resistant to amikacin antibiotic.</p><p>A total of six human pathogenic strains were used in this study. All Gram-positive organisms were identified by conventional methods, such as Gram stain, positive catalase, tube coagulase, deoxyribonucleases (DNAse) tests. An API 20E kit was used to identify the Gram-negative organism.</p><p>The agar well diffusion method in Mueller-Hinton agar plates was used for antimicrobial testing of essential oils. Incubation of inoculated bacteria was conducted for 12 h at a temperature of 37 &#x000b0;C, in Nutrient broth. A Mueller-Hinton agar plate was cultured with standardized microbial culture broth. Essential oils in concentrations of 50 mg/mL were prepared in organosulfur solvent ((CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO). Four wells of 8 mm were bored in the inoculated media. Each well was filled with 50 &#x003bc;L of essential oils: positive control of amikacin (30 mcg) and nitrofurantoin (300 mcg) and negative control. The diffusion process lasted for about 30 min at a temperature of 22.5 &#x000b0;C and incubation time for 18&#x02013;24 h at 37 &#x000b0;C. Following incubation, plates were examined to develop a clear zone around the well which corresponded to the antimicrobial activity. The zone of inhibition was detected and assessed (mm).</p><p>The broth microdilution method was used to establish the minimal inhibitory concentrations corresponding to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Twin successive dilutions of essential oils were conducted directly in a microtiter plate containing Mueller-Hinton broth. The bacterial inoculum was added to 5 &#x000d7; 105 CFU/mL in each well. An antibiotic amikacin was used for the control reference. Incubation of plates was performed at temperature of 37 &#x000b0;C for 24 h. Resazurin was added to each well of the microtiter plate and incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C for 30 min. The occurrence of pink color was associated with wells which displayed bacterial growth, while the blue color was associated with those without bacterial growth. The minimal inhibitory concentrations were considered as the lowest concentration of the essential oil that completely inhibits bacterial growth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-antibiotics-10-00546"><title>4.
