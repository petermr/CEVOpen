 <p>Many neglected tropical diseases have reservoirs in wildlife. The effects of human activities on wildlife include changes in species abundance, community composition, and the transmission dynamics of parasites. Introduced species, especially black rats (
  <italic>Rattus rattus</italic>) are known to transmit zoonotic diseases among wildlife species and people. 
  <italic>Leptospira</italic>, a water-borne bacterium that infects wildlife and people, is an important pathogen in the tropics, and in Madagascar, multiple strains and hosts have been identified. We tested how land use gradients in a forest-frontier agricultural system affect the composition of small mammal communities, and in turn the prevalence of 
  <italic>Leptospira</italic>. We investigated 11 species of small mammals, including native rodents and tenrecs, as well as introduced rodents and shrews, in old growth forest, forest fragments, agricultural fields, and in a village. 
  <italic>Leptospira</italic> prevalence and infection risk were highest in introduced species compared to native species and lower in forest fragments. The results highlight how the introduction of non-native species affects the variation in disease prevalence in small mammals, with potential consequences for spill-over to people.
