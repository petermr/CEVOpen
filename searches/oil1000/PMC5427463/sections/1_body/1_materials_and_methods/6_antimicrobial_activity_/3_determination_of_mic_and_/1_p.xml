<p class="p">The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum microbicidal concentration (MMC), which includes minimum bactericidal (MBC) and minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFC), using the broth dilution method (Güllüce et al., 2007[
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]) with minor modifications against the indicator strains, used in this study. The test was performed in sterile 96-well microplates with a final volume in each microplate well of 100 μL. For susceptibility testing, 90 μL of LB broth or PDB were distributed from the second to the twelfth test wells. A stock solution of the SoEO was prepared by dissolving 100 μL of the oil in ethanol and then adjusted to a final concentration of 50 mg/mL. The first well of the microplate was prepared by dispensing 170 μL of the growth medium and 10 μL of the SoEO to reach a final concentration of 10 mg/mL and then 90 μL of scalar dilutions were transferred from the second to the ninth well. Thereafter, 10 μL of indicator strain (final inoculum concentrations of 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> CFU/mL for bacteria and 10
 <sup class="sup">6 </sup>spores/mL for fungi) were added to each well. The final extract concentrations adopted to evaluate the antimicrobial activity were 0.039 to 10 mg/ mL. The tenth well was considered as positive growth control containing LB media for bacterial strains while PDB was used for fungi, since no essential oil solution was added. Another well containing 50 % ethanol (v/v), without SoEO, was used as a negative control. The plates were then covered with sterile plate covers and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h for bacterial strains and 72 h for fungi at 28 °C. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the total EO at which the microorganism does not demonstrate visible growth after incubation. As an indicator of microorganism growth, 25 μL of 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2 H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) (0.5 mg/mL) dissolved in sterile water were added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min (Eloff, 1998[

The MMCs were determined by serial subcultivation of 10 μL in LB or PDA plates and incubated at the optimal temperature of the indicator organism. The lowest concentration with no visible growth was defined as the MBC and the MFC, indicating ≥ 99.5 % killing of the original inoculum. 50 % ethanol was used as a negative control. The determinations of MIC, MBC and MFC values were done in triplicate and repeated twice.
