<p>These properties make the SoEO very promising as a source of botanical insecticides. This aspect has been largely exploited in the case of EOs from rosemary and other aromatic plants, which are effective against Lepidoptera and Coleoptera larvae (El Abdouni Khiyari et al., 2014[
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; Santana-Méridas et al., 2014[
 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]). At our knowledge, insecticidal activity of Tunisian SoEO has not yet been investigated. Moreover, allelopathic properties of 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> genus were also reported and the first studies that demonstrated the presence of volatile growth inhibitors produced by 
 <italic>Salvia </italic>species were carried out on 
 <italic>S. leucophylla </italic>and 
 <italic>S. apiana </italic>by Muller and Muller (1964[
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]). The effects of EOs extracted from 
 <italic>S. hierosolymitana</italic> and 
 <italic>S. multicaulis </italic>on germination and initial radical elongation of 
 <italic>Raphanus sativus </italic>L. (radish) and 
 <italic>Lepidium sativum </italic>L. (garden cress) showed different activities against the tested species (Mancini et al., 2009[
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]), while the phytotoxic activity of the SoEO from Tunisia has not been reported before.
