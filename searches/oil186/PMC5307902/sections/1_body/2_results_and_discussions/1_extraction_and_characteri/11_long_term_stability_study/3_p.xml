<p class="p">The studies by Guerra-Rosas, Morales-Castro,[
 <xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] showed that after the emulsification, the droplets migrate to the surface of the sample (coalescence) after a few hours of emulsification, forming a layer of cream. Consequently, there is a decrease of the CI over storage time in which the emulsion is preparing for phase separation.
