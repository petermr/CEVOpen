<p class="p">In vitro Brine Shrimp lethality bioassay of the essential oil was exploited to detect cytotoxicity by Mayer’s method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]. Brine Shrimp eggs were hatched in the brine solution (3.8% NaCl in distilled water) within 48 h. The samples were prepared by dissolving in DMSO solution (not more than 50 μL in 5 mL solution) and it was applied in 5 mL brine solution to attain the concentrations of 0.0195 to 10.0 μg/mL. DMSO (50 μL) was used as negative control. Standard vincristine sulphate (VcS) (0.078 μg/mL to 10.0 μg/mL) was used as positive control. Approximately 10 matured nauplii were taken to each vial. The numbers of surviving nauplii were counted after 24 h. The lethal concentrations (LC
 <sub class="sub">50</sub>) and the dose-response data were calculated by Biostate 2007 data analysis software.
