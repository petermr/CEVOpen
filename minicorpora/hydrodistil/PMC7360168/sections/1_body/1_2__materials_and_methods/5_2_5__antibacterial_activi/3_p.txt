0: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was evaluated according to published procedures [ 25,  26]; these concentrations were determined by the CLSI microdilution method (2006) on 96-well round bottomed microplates with some modifications.
1: For a concentration of 10 5 cfu/mL, 10 8 cfu/mL bacterial suspensions were diluted 1/1000 with the same culture medium (TS).
