<p>The emulsions at room temperature showed significant creaming formation in the first 24 h (D1) [
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. As the storage period increases, the emulsions showed a gradual increase in the creaming index (CI). The emulsions F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, F10, and F11 showed a phase separation process after 120 days. Therefore, phase separation of the emulsion F12 and F13 in D180 demonstrated instability of these formulations. The F14 formulation showed a high CI in D180. On the other hand, there was no phase separation of emulsions for F1, F2, F3, and F4. However, among these emulsions, the F1 had the lowest rate of creaming [
