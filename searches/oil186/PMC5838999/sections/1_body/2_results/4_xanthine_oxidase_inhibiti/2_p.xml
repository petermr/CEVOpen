<p id="Par56">Under non-inhibitory conditions, kinetic parameters for xanthine oxidase were K
 <sub>m</sub> = 0.003 μM and V
 <sub>max</sub> = 1.052 ΔOD/min. Assays with the essential oil induced a modification on V
 <sub>max</sub> (from 0.26 to 0.66 ΔOD/min), whereas the K
 <sub>m</sub> value was not changed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). As illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the slope and the vertical axis intercept increase with increasing essential oil concentration (2.5, 3.75 and 5 μg/mL). This result indicates that the essential oil components affected the velocity of the reaction catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, without affecting the Michaelis constant (K
 <sub>m</sub>). From these results, we can conclude that this inhibition is a non-competitive one, indicating that the components of the essential oil bind to a site other than the active one of the enzyme, without competing with the substrate.
