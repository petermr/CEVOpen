<p class="p">Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis resulted in the identification of 25 compounds for 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic>, as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. A total of 97.2% of the oil obtained from HD and 94.35% of the oil obtained from MAE were identified, and any compounds found at 0.05% or less were not considered for identification. Thymol (55.3%; 50.53%), p
 <italic class="italic">‐</italic>cymene (11.2%; 11.79%), carvacrol (8.7%; 6.65%), and β‐caryophyllene (4.2%, 4.88%) were the main components of the essential oils when using HD and MAE, respectively. Also, there was no significant difference (

The other important compounds were γ‐terpinene (3.4%; 1.37%), isoborneol (2.3%; 2.79%), linalool (1.7%; 2.22%), and acetovanillone (1.7%; 4.55%) when using HD and MAE, respectively. A similar study conducted with Iranian 
 <italic class="italic">T. vulgaris</italic> (Golmakani &amp; Rezaei, 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) reported lower thymol and carvacrol contents. Razzaghi‐Abyaneh et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) identified seven compounds in thyme and reported high thymol content (70.99%). Furthermore, Boruga et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) reported that the essential oil of thyme from Romania had lower thymol (47.59%) and p
 <italic class="italic">‐</italic>cymene (8.41%) levels but a much higher γ‐terpinene content (30.9%).
