<p>The antibacterial activity of
 <italic> R. carthamoides</italic> root essential oils may be associated with the presence of the major components of essential oils such as cyperene, 13-norcypera-1(5),11(12)-diene, and cadalene in the HR essential oil and aplotaxene, nardosina-1(10),11-diene, and dauca-4(11),8-diene in the SGR essential oil. To the best of our knowledge, the microbiological activities of these compounds have not been investigated. In literature, we only found that essential oils from
 <italic> Cyperus rotundus</italic> and
 <italic> C. articulatus </italic>containing cyperene as the main component showed antimicrobial effects against different strains of bacteria and fungi [
