  <title>Background</title>
  <p id="Par1">
   <italic>Tagetes minuta</italic> has a long record of human use for the treatment of stomach and intestinal diseases. Most drugs used for diseases treatment are less efficacious with side effects and this brought the search for new treatment regimens mainly from medicinal plants.

  <title>Method</title>
  <p id="Par2">The essential oil (EO) was extracted by Clevenger’s-type apparatus and its chemical composition, antioxidant and antibacterial properties were determined by GC-MS, spectrophotometric and broth dilution methods respectively. 
   <italic>S. uberis</italic>, 
   <italic>E. cloacae</italic>, 
   <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
   <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, 
   <italic>L. ivanovii</italic>, 
   <italic>Vibrio</italic> spp. and 
   <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria strains were used as test bacteria.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par3">GC-MS analysis revealed 98 compounds in the EO flower of 
   <italic>T. minuta</italic> and β-Ocimene (14. 40%) was the major chemical constituents. The EO exhibited highest inhibitory effect against DPPH radical, followed by its effect on ABTS, while LP radical showed the least sensitivity with IC
   <sub>50</sub> values of 2.45 mg/mL, 2.76 mg/mL and 3.23 mg/mL respectively. The EO showed antibacterial activities against all test organisms with MIC value for 
   <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
   <italic>M. smegatis</italic> and 
   <italic>S. uberis</italic> at 0.125 mg/mL and for 
   <italic>L. ivanovii</italic>, 
   <italic>Vibrio</italic> spp., 
   <italic>E. cloacae</italic> and 
   <italic>E. coli</italic> at 0.06 mg/mL. The EO showed MBC against 
   <italic>E. cloacae</italic> and 
   <italic>E. coli</italic> at 0.06 mg/mL at 0.5 mg/mL for 
   <italic>S. uberis</italic> and 0.125 mg/mL for 
   <italic>Vibrio</italic> spp.

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p id="Par4">Findings from this study suggest that the EO of 
   <italic>T. minuta</italic> flower may be a useful candidate in the search for lead constituents for the synthesis of new potent antibacterial and antioxidant agent.
