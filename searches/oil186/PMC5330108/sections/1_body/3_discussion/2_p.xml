<p class="p">Extracellular enzymes are synthesized inside the cell and then secreted outside the cell, where their function is to break down complex macromolecules into smaller units to be taken up by the cell for growth and assimilation. Extracellular pH was determined to explain the release of the cellular material and the changes of membrane permeabilization. Results showed that, after the treatment of the MPE, the release of cell constituents in the fungi suspensions visibly increased compare to control. Meanwhile, after 30 min of exposure, the MPE apparently induced the leakage of intracellular protons as evidenced by the decrease in the values of extracellular pH. These findings suggest the irreversible damage to the cytoplasmic membranes of
