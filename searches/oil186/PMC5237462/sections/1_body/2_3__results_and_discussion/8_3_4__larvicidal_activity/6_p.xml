<p>The evaluation of larvicidal activity is in agreement with studies made by Pavela et al. [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. That determined the value LC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> against larvae of
 <italic> Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>, having as a major component the monoterpene which is L-(−)-menthol, in which the participation in the EO differs depending on the genotype of 20.5% to 57.3%, together with carvone (0.0 to 56.8%) and piperitenone oxide (0.0 to 31.8%).
