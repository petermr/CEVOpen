<p class="p">The free radical scavenging capacity of the essential oils and two positive controls, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT; Sigma, W218405) and ascorbic acid (Sigma A4403), was assessed from bleaching the purple-colored methanol solution of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) according to the method of Brand-Williams et al. (1995). In such process, various methanolic oil concentrations (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80 and 100 μg/m1) were mixed with the same volume of a 0.2 mM methanolic solution of DPPH (Sigma, D9132). After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the absorbance was recorded at 517 nm using a UV/VIS spectrophotometer. The free radical scavenging capacity was calculated as follows:</p>
