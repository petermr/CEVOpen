<p class="p">A Gram-positive bacterium protects its cytoplasmic membrane with a thick cell wall. The layers of peptidoglycan prevent the passage of hydrophilic compounds due to the presence of sugars and amino acids. The outer lipoprotein membrane presents characteristics and the bacteria need to have a mechanism enabling the entry of hydrophilic compounds like sugars, amino acids, and ions. Therefore, the outer membrane has special channels called porins, which allow the passive diffusion of hydrophilic compounds [
