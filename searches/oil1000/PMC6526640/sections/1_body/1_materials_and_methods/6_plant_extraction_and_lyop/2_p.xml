<p class="p">Two solvents were used to extract polar fractions of the 
 <italic class="italic">Thymus vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Thymbra spicata</italic>. Ten grams of sample was weighed into a beaker. Then, either 100 ml of 80% aqueous methanol (1:10 ratio of w/v) or 100 ml of 80% aqueous ethanol (1:10 ratio of w/v) was measured and placed into the beaker and shaken for 30 min to provide even mixing. Next, it was sonicated for 30 min, after which the slurry was filtered using a Buchner funnel, vacuum flask, and Whatman
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> no. 1 filter paper. With the filtered solution in the dark and under refrigeration, the sonication procedure was repeated two more times. The collected filtrates were combined, and the liquid extract was placed into a 500‐ml round‐bottom flask. The aqueous methanol or aqueous ethanol solution was completely evaporated using a rotary evaporator at 50°C. Then, extracts were frozen at −80°C and freeze‐dried. The dried extracts were stored in the dark for later analysis. The proper amount of lyophilized extracts was dissolved in a 50% methanolic solution and filtered with a 0.45‐µm filter before use in the HPLC procedure.
