<p class="p">The MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) and MBC (minimal bactericidal concentration) tests were performed (in triplicate) by the broth microdilution method. The essential oils were dissolved in DMSO (Sigma). Serial dilutions (1 : 2) from 2.5% (v/v) as the essential oil concentrations to be incubated at 37°C for 24 h with the bacterial suspensions adjusted to 10
