 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]. Minerals were analyzed by dry-ashing 1 g of the sample at 550 °C in a furnace. The ash obtained was dissolved in 10% HCl, filtered with filter paper and made up to standard volume with deionised water. Flame photometer was used to determine sodium and potassium contents of the samples, while calcium, iron and magnesium contents were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Model 403) [
