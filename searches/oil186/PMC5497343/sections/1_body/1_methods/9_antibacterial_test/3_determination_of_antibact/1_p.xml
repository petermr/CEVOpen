<p id="Par19">The modified method of Gullon et al., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] was adopted for the determination of MIC and MBC of the essential oil
 <italic>.</italic> Two fold serial dilutions were carried out under aseptic condition in sterile micro centrifuge tubes in a total volume of 100 μL of Muller Hinton (MH) broth mixed with the essential oil of various concentrations ranging from 0.03–0.5 mg/mL. Thereafter, 20 μL of each of the inoculums dilution matching 0.5 Mc-Farland standard was added into tubes of various concentrations and votexed. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as a diluting chemical solvent as reported by Okoh et al., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Ciprofloxacin (0.03–0.5 mg/mL) was used as positive controls containing the organisms and solution of Ciprofloxacin while DMSO 5% was used as negative control containing only DMSO and the various bacteria strains. The tube containing essential oil and MH broth was used as sterility control. The tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. MIC was measured by comparing the turbidity of the tubes containing bacteria and essential oil with the tube containing MH broth and essential oil only. MIC was expressed as the lowest concentration without bacteria growth (absence of turbidity). The viability of the bacteria strains screened was verified by inoculating 20 μL of aliquots of all the tubes after incubation of various concentration on MH agar plates using the spread plate method, incubated at 37 °C, for 24 h. MBC was expressed as the lowest concentration of the essential oil that prevented microbial growth on MH agar plates.
