<p class="p">Gas chromatographic (GC) analysis was performed on Agilent gas chromatograph, Model 7890A, equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). Analytical conditions were HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm coated with 5% phenyl methyl silicone, 95% dimethyl polysiloxane, 0.25 µm film thickness) and helium as the carrier gas (1 mL/min). Injection was done in split mode (1:60), injected volume was 1 µL (10% essential oil/CH

The oven temperature was held at 50 °C for 1 min, then increased to 240 °C at 5 °C/min and held at 240 °C for 5 min. Percentages of compounds were determined from their peak areas in the GC-FID profiles.
