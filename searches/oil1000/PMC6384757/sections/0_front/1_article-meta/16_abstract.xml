  <italic class="italic">Artemisia argyi</italic> Lévl. et Vant essential oil could be used as a good antimicrobial flavouring agent and applied in the food industry. In this study, three methods, including simultaneous distillation-extraction (SDE), subcritical extraction and hydrodistillation, were applied to extract 
  <italic class="italic">A. argyi</italic> essential oil. Compared with subcritical extraction (1%) and hydrodistillation (0.5%), SDE gave a higher yield (1.2%). Components of the essential oils were analysed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the most abundant ingredients were caryophyllene oxide, neointermedeol, borneol, α-thujone and β-caryophyllene. These five components accounted for 82.93%, 40.90% and 40.33% for SDE, subcritical extraction, and hydrodistillation, respectively. Based on agar disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays, SDE oil showed a significant inhibitory effect towards

  <italic class="italic">Escherichia coli</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Proteus vulgaris</italic>, 
  <italic class="italic">Salmonella enteritidis</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">Aspergillus niger</italic>. Furthermore, electron microscope observations (SEM) confirmed that SDE oil could obviously deform cell morphology and destroy the structure of cell walls. Performances showed that SDE was a promising process for extracting 
  <italic class="italic">A. argyi</italic> essential oil with both high yield and antimicrobial activity.
