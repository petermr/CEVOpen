<p>Vitamin E includes four isomers (
 <italic>α</italic>, 
 <italic>β</italic>, 
 <italic>δ</italic>, and 
 <italic>γ</italic>) of tocopherol and four isomers (
 <italic>α</italic>, 
 <italic>β</italic>, 
 <italic>δ</italic>, and 
 <italic>γ</italic>) of tocotrienol. The contents of total and individual tocopherols and tocotrienols of
 <italic> L. kerstingii</italic> seed oil are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab5">Table 5</xref>. The results revealed the presence of the three tocopherols (
 <italic>α</italic>, 
 <italic>δ</italic>, and 
 <italic>γ</italic>). Β-Tocopherol and tocotrienols were not detected in the oil. Total amount of tocopherols was 578.60 mg/kg, which was similar to that reported for
 <italic> L. microcarpa</italic> and higher than that recorded in grapeseed oil (140.60 mg/kg), peanut oil (398.60 mg/kg), and olive oil (216.80 mg/kg) [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. 
 <italic>γ</italic>-Tocopherol was the most abundant, with a value of 82% of the total tocopherol content, followed by 
 <italic>α</italic>-tocopherol (12%) and 
 <italic>δ</italic>-tocopherol (6%). The antioxidant activity of tocopherols decreased in the order of 
 <italic>γ</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>δ</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>α</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>β</italic> [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The significant quantity of 
 <italic>γ</italic>-tocopherols found in
 <italic> L. kerstingii</italic> seed oil could contribute to its high oxidative stability.
