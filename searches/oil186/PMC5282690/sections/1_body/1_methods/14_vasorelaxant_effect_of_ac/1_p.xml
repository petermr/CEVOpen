<p>The involvement of potassium channels in the vasorelaxant effect was assessed following the experimental procedure previously detailed, with some variations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Endothelium-intact rings were incubated with the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-activated potassium channels, TEA (10
 <sup>−2</sup>M; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 6), the selective voltage-activated potassium channel (K
 <sub>
  <italic>v</italic>
 </sub>) blocker, 4-AP (10
 <sup>−4</sup>M; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 6), the selective inwardly-rectifying potassium channel blocker, BaCl
 <sub>2</sub> (10
 <sup>−4</sup>M; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 6), and the selective ATP-sensitive potassium channel blocker, glybenclamide (10
 <sup>−5</sup>M; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) for 20 min prior to contraction with Phen (1 μM), then, the cumulative concentration–response curves of AcEO were constructed and compared with those obtained with untreated rings.
