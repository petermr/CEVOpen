<p class="p">Semi-quantitative GC was performed with an Agilent 6890 GC with Agilent FID (flame ionization detector) (Agilent Technologies), HP-5ms column (30 m length × 0.25 mm inner diameter × 0.25 μm film thickness), He carrier gas, head pressure (144.1 kPa), flow rate (2.0 mL/min); oven temperature program (as above). The percent compositions of the essential oils were determined from raw peak area percentages without standardization.</p>
