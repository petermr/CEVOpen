<p>The isolated oil was diluted with hexane (dilution ratio 1:10), and 1 mL was sampled for the gas chromatographic analysis. Trace gas chromatograph (GC) (ULTRA S/N 20062969, Thermo Fischer, Villebon-sur-Yvette, France) that is equipped with HP-5MS non polar fused silica capillary column (60 m × 0.32 mm, film thickness 0.25 mm) was used. Operating conditions: oven temperature program from 50 °C (2 min) to 280 °C at 5 °C/min and the final temperature kept for 10 min; 2 “split mode” ratio 1:20; carrier gas Azoth (N), flow rate 1 mL/min; temperature of injector and detector (flame ionization detector) were fixed at 250 °C and 280 °C, respectively.</p>
