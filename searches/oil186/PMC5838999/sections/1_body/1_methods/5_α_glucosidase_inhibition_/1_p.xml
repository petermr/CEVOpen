<p id="Par31">A spectrophotometric α-glucosidase assay was performed as previously described by Tao et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] with slight modifications as detailed by Rengasamy et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The mixture of α-glucosidase reaction contained 2.5 mM 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG), 250 μL of essential oil in DMSO and 0.3 U/mL of α-glucosidase in phosphate buffer, pH 6.9. Pure control having 100% enzyme activity was conducted by replacing the essential oil with DMSO. Blank for pure control having 0% enzyme activity was conducted with DMSO and by replacing the enzyme with buffer. In positive controls, acarbose, which is clinically used as an α-glucosidase inhibitor, replaced the essential oil. Absorbance of the released 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenol (pNP) was measured (405 nm) and was considered proportional to the activity of the enzyme. Each sample was carried out in triplicate. Inhibition percentage by essential oil and acarbose were calculated using the following equation:
