<p>Physicochemical properties of
 <italic> L. kerstingii</italic> seed oil are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">Table 4</xref>. The oil was liquid at 19.67°C. The refractive index of oils depends on their molecular weight, fatty acid chain length, degree of unsaturation, and degree of conjugation. The refractive index of
 <italic> L. kerstingii</italic> seed oil was 1.47, which was similar to the values of
 <italic> Acacia senegal</italic> (L.) Willd. (1.47) and
 <italic> Lannea microcarpa</italic> (1.47) and higher than
 <italic> Phoenix canariensis</italic> Hort. ex Chabaud (1.45) seed oils [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The refractive index is positively related to iodine value, which is a measure of the degree of unsaturation of the oils and gives an idea of their oxidative stability.
